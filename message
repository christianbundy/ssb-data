Off the top of my head:\r\n\r\n- Follow, unfollow, block, unblock\r\n- More networking info and actions (including offline mode)\r\n- Way faster private message rendering\r\n- Works with Patchwork running in background (!)\r\n- Sidebar navigation with cute emoji\r\n- Very very basic internationalization (need help translating!)\r\n- Removed strangers from main feed\r\n- Add Extended and Topics views\r\n- Add public viewer mode\r\n- Fix 8 trillion bugs\r\n\r\nIf anyone wants to check it out, I'll include the install instructions below. There's also a [public demo](http://oasis-demo.fraction.io/) and a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fraction/oasis) if you like.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nMost people should install stable releases with [npm](https://npmjs.org/).\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nnpm --global install @fraction/oasis@latest\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease make sure that your Node.js version is the [**current** or **active LTS** release](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).\r\n\r\nFor faster updates and less stability, install from GitHub and upgrade often.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nnpm --global install github:fraction/oasis\r\n```\r\n\r\nWant more? Check out [`install.md`](https://github.com/fraction/oasis/blob/master/docs/install.md).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n#oasis",
