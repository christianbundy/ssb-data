Most SSB interfaces show posts in full, maybe adding a \"read more\" if it gets *way* too long, but I think it's still too hard to skim the list of messages.\r\n\r\nLately I've been experimenting with a summarized view, which only shows the first line of the message. If you select it, it expands to let you view the full message. Should this be the default? Here's a screenshot of how it looks when only one message is expanded:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of Oasis posts with a few messages summarized to a one-line description and one expanded](&rxIqoK11dF1zrMSy3u8yu3W5S8YtMj4838V0cWtXNDs=.sha256)\r\n\r\nI'd love to get feedback on how to make SSB more ergonomic. Our network is filled with so much wonderful content, but I want to empower people to easily skip things that they don't want to read. To be explicit, I'm considering summarizing content in the popular and latest views, but I think we should probably keep the expanded messages in the thread view.\r\n\r\n**Note:** I agree that \"make it optional\" is a nice way to side-step the problem, but there's great power in setting reasonable defaults.",
