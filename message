IIRC [@piet](@U5GvOKP/YUza9k53DSXxT0mk3PIrnyAmessvNfZl5E0=.ed25519)'s Android app has `AND` and `NOT` and stuff, which I'd imagine is super useful. There's gotta be an existing query language for this sort of thing, right?\r\n\r\nI've been keeping an eye on [`rq`](https://github.com/dflemstr/rq), which is like `jq` but for JSON/CBOR/YAML/ProtoBuf/etc, and since they dropped their internal query language I've been waiting to see people chime in on [this issue](https://github.com/dflemstr/rq/issues/208) with thoughts on One Truse Query Language.\r\n\r\nNothing yet, just crickets.",
