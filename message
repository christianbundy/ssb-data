GitHub made a [pretty graph](https://github.com/christianbundy/ssb-git-data/graphs/contributors) of my SSB usage history.\r\n- If clients could replicate with Git repositories then this would make it super easy to create a \"personal pub\" for a person or organization. I'm not super excited about GitHub hosting, but something like Git-over-HTTP-over-{Tor,I2P,Yggdrasil,cjdns} might have lots of utility.\r\n- I'm really wondering how this sort of experiment would interact with our ideas about \"public hosting\". I have no expectation of privacy on public messages on Scuttlebutt, since the point is to gossip around messages as widely as possible, but I think that some people would feel bad if I added their feed to a public Git repository. Maybe not? Seems like a thing worth discussing. Regardless, I'd like to avoid ",
