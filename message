It sounds like this would create a way for peers to connect to others who are choosing to gather around some subject (\"subject\" in the general sense, whether that's a server or a topic), which I'm very excited about. \n\n:question: Am I correct to understand that this implementation would require one server per room? If so, I'd love to hear more about the trade-offs between using ssb-rooms and using something like [discovery-swarm](https://github.com/mafintosh/discovery-swarm), which would allow peers to gather around some subject and share data *without* a server as an intermediary. I know you've used discovery-swarm in the past to [exchange invites with ssb-discovery-swarm](https://github.com/staltz/ssb-discovery-swarm/), so I'm curious what benefits come from intermediary servers.\n\n:tada: Thanks for writing up this proposal! I know you've been doing lots of work in both the foreground and the background on ssb-rooms, and I'm excited to learn more about it.    ",
