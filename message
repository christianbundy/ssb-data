As long as they donâ€™t change we do stay in contact.\r\n\r\nIf my device is behind [NAT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) then you don't have a way to start a new connection to it. If your device is *also* behind NAT, we need some third-party service without a NAT that we can both connect to.\r\n\r\nRight now, SSB uses pubs for this, but we could probably use some other system(s) like [STUN](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) instead. Either way, we'd need to have a server with a public IP address that isn't stuck behind a NAT *or* an overlay network to bridge our devices.",
