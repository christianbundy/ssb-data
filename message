I've never worked with Remark, but I'm working on a [ssb-markdown refactor](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-markdown/pull/24) that's *almost* 100% backward-compatible with the current ssb-markdown. The only difference is that the current ssb-markdown still tries to turn @words @like @these into mentions, so I'm trying to figure out which clients (and/or versions) are still posting text-only mentions.\n\nDefinitely keep me updated on your Markdown work, I'd be super interested to see what you come up with!",
