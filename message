I've had a nice setup at my coworking space, but at home I've often just used my laptop and a couch. I snagged my keyboard from the office over the weekend, so now I've got a standing desk setup in the kitchen that's Not Bad. My laptop is resting on a case of Mountain House freeze-dried food that I've had since forever and keyboard is split between two plastic containers to get the height right.\r\n\r\nWhat about you, have you been able to stay mostly ergonomic at home?",
