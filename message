These words got me:\r\n\r\n> It has the fastest, most secure encryption algorithm of any chat app.\r\n\r\nTheir [\"how it works\" page](https://beechat.network/how-beechats-encryption-works/) seems to double down on this claim:\r\n\r\n> [...] BeeChat uses the most advanced yet simple encryption of any chat application.\r\n\r\nI'll look at their code when it's released (on Dominic's birthday, right?), but I have to admit that I'm super skeptical. Clicking around the website took me to the forum, which has 1 member and 1 post, but when looking at their profile another menu item popped into the nav bar: [Artificial Intelligence](https://beechat.network/artificial-intelligence/).\r\n\r\nLast note: I did a quick web search and the only thing that came up was [their announcement post... on 4chan](http://boards.4channel.org/g/thread/75148547/beechat-network-p2p-encrypted-comms-april-release). I am very very very very very very skeptical of this project.",
