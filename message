I started out with the 16:8 and ate between 12:00 and 20:00, but usually I'm pretty productive around noon so I don't break for lunch until the mid-afternoon.\n\nThat's great, do you feel any different? It *does* feel funny to refer to 14 hours without food as \"fasting\", but I really think it's a big shift from how most of us have been eating for most of our lives, especially when it comes to snacking. It's *much* harder to snack between meals when you're completely stuffed between all of your meals.\n\nAfter decreasing to two meals per day I've started thinking of trying out *one meal a day* ( #omad ), but I'm not sure I'd be able to hit my calorie/macro/micro needs with only one meal.\n\n[@neale](@J233HHh6iMA7LxT+KnCbtI3GeaCJ7gW7dkB/63ObSJY=.ed25519) are you still fasting?",
