It's a super simple command-line interface for SSB, similar to [muxrpcli](https://github.com/fraction/ssb-cli#readme) but based on [yargs](https://github.com/fraction/ssb-cli#readme). Compatible with Patchwork, Patchbay, Oasis, SSB-Server, or your favorite SSB service.\r\n\r\nIt's still under development (and it's unearthed a handful of problems in the stack) but I'd love thoughts and feedback. \r\n\r\n#ssb-cli",
