I've never made them from scratch before. I went to a friend's house to celebrate Chinese New Year but I think they had pre-made the wrapper? Or bought them at the store, I don't remember. Kathleen and I struggled to wrap the filling and do all the folds, but it was fun.\r\n\r\nAside: my friend's girlfriend is from the Midwest US and they recently tried to come up with some Chinese + Midwest fusion. I didn't try any of them, but they told me about their [bao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baozi) [sloppy joes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloppy_joe) and I can't stop thinking about how ridiculous but good that sounds. Founds some [photos](http://www.cookingwithcocktailrings.com/mains/2017/sloppy-bao-buns) from someone else who made something similar.",
