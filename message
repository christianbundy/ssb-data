Since triviality can't be circular or turtles all the way down, you eventually have to assume that something is \"common knowledge\" and build triviality on top of that.\r\n\r\nI guess that means that any concept of trivial technology needs a target demographic? Like \"trivial for python devs\" or \"trivial for web devs\" or \"trivial for assembly programmers\" or something.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is a really cool idea and I hope my navel gazing doesn't distract from that. ðŸ˜¬",
