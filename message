I *think* they only care about the main identity.\r\n\r\nI think a cleaner solution would be to restart the SSB service when you change identities, but there are two problems:\r\n\r\n- I don't think Patchwork or Patchbay can even connect to SSB running as a daemon (?)\r\n- Even if they could, I don't think that they could handle the SSB service restarting with a new identity\r\n\r\n> Could it be too much megabytes to copy between the daemon and the .ssb folder?\r\n\r\nIf this was a problem, you could probably use a symbolic link instead of actually moving files around in the filesystem.",
