There are a few bugs (e.g. inline blobs aren't working), but otherwise it seems like an easy way for SSB friends to see how Oasis looks right now. I should mention that it's very experimental and very much a work-in-progress.\r\n\r\nThe messages you'll see are the same public messages you'd see if you downloaded a client like Patchwork and followed me, but I've politely asked search engines to avoid indexing any of the content with [`.htaccess`](http://oasis-demo.fraction.io/.htaccess).\r\n\r\nI'd love feedback, if anyone has thoughts or feels they'd like to share.\r\n\r\n#oasis",
