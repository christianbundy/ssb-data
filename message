I think the SSID might be subjective, so each of us could try different names for various purposes, but I think it would really be nice to share the software that:\n\n- serves a captive portal webpage with:\n  - an instance of the viewer for people to preview the network ( #ssb-viewer )\n  - downloads of the latest client installers for each platform \n  - some sort of documentation or user manual or something?\n- runs a pub in the background that provides messages from peers on the internet\n- maybe provides a \"public\" IP address to peer with others ( #cjdns )\n\nWhat do you think would be best?",
