If `common-good fix` is behaving correctly, the expected behavior would be that that those lines would look like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  const read_key = derive(msg_key, labels.read_key)\r\n  const header_key = derive(read_key, labels.header_key) // I want this indentation because it helps understand key derivation\r\n  const body_key = derive(read_key, labels.body_key)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou could have [Prettier ignore](https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore.html) that code if you wanted, but the default expectation would be that those lines are formatted predictably.\r\n\r\n> you ran `common-good` with no args. Thatâ€™s not documented / what do?\r\n\r\nOh, that's the same as `common-good check`. I'm not sure if that's a helpful shortcut or just plain confusing.\r\n\r\n> I thought the point was to provide an opinion not have to generate one?\r\n\r\nYeah, that's one of two frustrations I have right now:\r\n\r\n- TypeScript won't let me install `@types/node` in common-good, they want it installed directly in the project we're linting. Boo.\r\n- ESLint doesn't have a default config, it has a 'recommended' config, and it's not straightforward to use.\r\n\r\nI'll see if I can fix the ESLint thing and avoid having you install Yet Another Thing.",
