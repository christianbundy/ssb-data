This blog, which now doubles as a travel diary, helps measure our progress, while giving us another creative output. We cook and travel, and adapt to the local produce whenever possible. All of the recipes we make are plant-based, and tree-nut free.\r\n\r\nFound a cool vegan food blog with an awesome little section on [nutrition](https://grimgrains.com/#nutrition). Haven't dug in, but it seems kinda cool.\r\n\r\nI should point out: the *charcoal toothpaste* thing sticks out as a red flag to me. It might be fine, but after reading a few articles I'm a bit concerned about the side-effects of charcoal on tooth enamel. [This article](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/negative-effects-of-charcoal-toothpaste_n_5b460487e4b07aea754647e4) explained the problem well, but I'd imagine that [this paper might have some better information](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41415-019-0232-8). I don't know enough to make a call either way. Do your own research. ðŸ™ƒ",
