    "text": "Hot take of the day: your website design would probably be better if you stuck to two spatial dimensions. Maybe [elevation](https://material.io/design/environment/elevation.html) is useful in some contexts but I think it's usually confusing and overly complicated.\r\n\r\nGive me an interface that you could make with paper that doesn't overlap! Sticky headers, modal windows, overlays, and faux-3D shadows are out. ðŸ™ƒ\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, one great use of 3D effects is a map interface: Please give me buttons that ominously hover above my city! The alterative would be to put the buttons and interface *on* the map, and I don't think anyone wants that. If my screen needs to present three spatial dimensions then I'd rather have a consistent interface, but when in doubt, don't add another dimension.",
