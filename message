We tried to find more, but the local stores were out of dairy-free nog (!) so we decided to make some by ourselves. It was.... shockingly easy? It's in the fridge now, but the taste I had after blending it was Very Good.\n\nAside: I'm a bit bummed that *Minimalist Baker* is now doing lots of recipes with meat in them. It's been my go-to recommendation for cheap and easy recipes that have been mostly vegan-friendly, but now 7/8 entrees on the homepage have animal products.
