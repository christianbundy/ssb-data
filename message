For example:\n\n- **Before**: `<host>:<port>:@<integer>~<secret>`\n- **After**: `ssb://<host>:<port>/?ref=feed:ed25519:<integer>&secret=<secret>`\n\nI'm not against using multiserver addresses if they can't be reasonably translated into URLs, so multiserver URIs might look something like `ssb:?ms=<ms>`, which is fine as long as we use a URI-safe base64 encoding. I think it would be beneficial to use clickable pub invites -- are those multiserver addresses, or are they multiserver-adjacent addresses? I've noticed that most/all TCP pub invites don't include the `net:` prefix but I'm not sure why. ",
