This made me realize how useful it would be to have all of my private messages on a separate feed:\n\n- my public feed would be legal to broadcast over amateur radio\n- peers can choose whether they trust me enough to replicate my encrypted content\n- removing timestamp data from the private feed would make time correlation harder\n  - we could already do this, but our public messages hint at when the private message was sent\n\nI'm super excited for all the possibilities once #same-as is rolled out.",
