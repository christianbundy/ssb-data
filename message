I'm happy you replied.\r\n\r\nAlso, I appreciate that bit on making yogurt -- the best resource I found was [this](https://cooking.stackexchange.com/questions/30547/how-to-make-yogurt-without-any-existing-yogurt), which makes me even more skeptical of my ability to make yogurt without already having yogurt on hand.\r\n\r\n> we got a lot of leftover junk that can be made into something else, so we might be able to get by without so much miningâ€¦\r\n\r\nYeah! We're also very lucky to live in a world where many of these problems are already solved, so we can buy things from stores -- but I'd feel really good about knowing that we could take care of our own needs if that privilege went away.\r\n\r\n> lots of practices like agriculture and manufacturing would be better done differently.\r\n\r\nI think this is one of the things that I'm most excited about: I have a hunch that lots of our supply chain is the way that it is because of ~~hysterical raisins~~ historical reasons, and I'd be interested to see which patterns we could/should leave out. I'd be willing to bet that the Pareto principle is especially useful when looking at rebuilding vast supply chain networks.",
