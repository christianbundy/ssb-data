I'm really excited to work on feed deletion and a full node working in the browser, but I really want to avoid any role as a mediator or go-between or anything like that, you know? It's totally possible that we're already on the same page on this, I just wanted to outline where my boundaries are so you have a feel for where I'm coming from.\n\n> I've cloned it down, and I'll give the code examples a walk through after work today.\n\nSweet, it was [super helpful for me](%Ej0uOWJjnl7sWhJYx91Cq6oYlUiu+tZucTrCesEEI8o=.sha256) so I hope you have a similar experience. I've also started [a repo](https://github.com/fraction/flumedb-delete) with my current progress on deleting feeds from flumedb -- it's not very clean, but maybe we can iterate on it!\n\n> I'm def down to have a call. When is a good time for you?\n\nI'm over in Portland (PST) and weekdays between 07:00 and 15:00 work best for me, but I'm happy to do something later or on the weekends depending on when you're available. Do you have Signal, or some other chat app you like?",
