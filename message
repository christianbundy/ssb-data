By the way, I just wanted to document a small bug I found where [this thread](%qt3mrsu50kfJ5zhTrZfE7RVhNw/69iDYTvuFlg7b8NE=.sha256) stays bold regardless of how many times I try to refresh or restart Patchbay. My guess is that it's a weird edge-case where a double-posting thread author with no replies is falsely identified as an unread thread, but I haven't spent any time looking into it.\n\nPlease don't spend any time/energy on this unless you're *really* bored, it doesn't bother me at all and my guess is that it's not a common bug.",
