Super stoked on this.\r\n\r\nI don't know what city you're in, but Portland has an annual vegfest at the convention center that's *wonderful* for trying all of the state of the art vegan cheeses. I've only gone twice but I've spent 90% of my time trying cheeses. If your city has a vegfest or similar, it might be worth your time.\r\n\r\n> ON that note; I need to make a site dedicated to rating how close something is to itâ€™s vegan equivalent.\r\n\r\nI would cherish this resource and treat it as my own personal bible.",
