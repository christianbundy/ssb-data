    "text": "It me.\n\nBackground: On the last day of scuttle-camp we had a session about starting a NZ incorporated society to make it easier to handle money in the Scuttlebutt ecosystem. We were given the [sample rules ](http://www.societies.govt.nz/cms/incorporated-societies/rules-of-incorporated-societies/sample-set-of-rules) and asked whether we would sign, and a few of us were hesitant to sign a document with bits like:\n\n- > The purposes of the Society are to: [Insert specific purposes];\n- > No Society Meeting may be held unless at least [number] % of eligible Members attend. (This will constitute a quorum.)\n- > Any proposed motion to amend or replace these Rules shall be signed by at least [number] % of eligible Members and given in writing to the Secretary at least 28 days before the Society Meeting at which the motion is to be considered, and accompanied by a written explanation of the reasons for the proposal.\n- > The surplus Money and Other Assets shall be distributed to: [Stipulate one or more organisations/purposes].\n\nI've got lots of trust for everyone that was involved, but I didn't feel comfortable signing a legal document with blanks that still needed to be filled in. It was also the last session before scuttle-camp was over, so by the time we realized that the document was unfinished there wasn't enough time to finish writing it. I think everyone was bummed about this.\n\nSince [@zenna](@3ZeNUiYQZisGC6PLf3R+u2s5avtxLsXC66xuK41e6Zk=.ed25519) and I were the most hesitant to sign we volunteered to fill in the blanks and propose a fleshed-out set of rules, but I've *personally* been a bit swamped and put it on the back-burner. I'm sorry about that, I don't like the feeling of being a bottleneck.\n\nI'll reach out and see if we can't get this wrapped in in the next few days -- currently we're stuck on which organization(s) should receive the assets if/when the incorporated society winds down, but we might just need to ask for help from local friends who are more familiar. \n\n[@ktorn](@z8aJVHJTc6MM8FwaNE2GIS3AYYt2HYFNWQUO8/iydNw=.ed25519) Thanks for making this thread, I hadn't seen Alanna's post and this definitely deserves attention.\n\n[@alanna](@6OxffMLNyxkboLjCqv29WnMPhH8O3qFrcXCR6KrKcPI=.ed25519) Sorry this got placed on the back-burner for me, I know that it's important and will make money stuff easier for everyone involved.",
