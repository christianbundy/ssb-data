I've tried lots of alternatives (pkg, nexe, etc) and talked to friends and Electron is the only packaging method that seems to work correctly all the time. \r\n\r\nThe exception to this rule: I wrote a [terrible little script](https://github.com/fraction/oasis/blob/master/scripts/build.sh) that builds installers without Chromium, but it comes with a big directory and doesn't actually integrate with your OS. Packaging Node.js scripts is hard. ðŸ¤·",
