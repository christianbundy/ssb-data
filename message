It is a z80 kernel and a collection of programs, tools and documentation that allows you to assemble an OS that can:\r\n>\r\n> 1. Run on minimal and improvised machines.\r\n> 2. Interface through improvised means (serial, keyboard, display).\r\n> 3. Edit text files.\r\n> 4. Compile assembler source files for a wide range of MCUs and CPUs.\r\n> 5. Read and write from a wide range of storage devices.\r\n> 6. Replicate itself.\r\n>\r\n> Additionally, the goal of this project is to be as self-contained as possible. With a copy of this project, a capable and creative person should be able to manage to build and install Collapse OS without external resources (i.e. internet) on a machine of her design, built from scavenged parts with low-tech tools. \r\n\r\n> ## [Collapse OS -- Why](https://collapseos.org/why.html\r\n>\r\n>  I expect our global supply chain to collapse before we reach 2030. With this collapse, we won't be able to produce most of our electronics because it depends on a very complex supply chain that we won't be able to achieve again for decades (ever?). \r\n\r\n#collapse #collapse-os",
