The only bit that was fuzzy was the part about a \"flag\". You can either follow or block an SSB feed, so *technically* there isn't a \"flag\", but generally if you block someone publicly that's a metaphorical red flag and if you follow someone publicly that's basically vouching for them.\r\n\r\nAside: private following and private blocking is relatively new, so most follows and blocks are public. I'm super curious what the network would look like if those actions were private by default, so the only public follows/blocks had strong semantics about your relationship with somebody.",
