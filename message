I'm feeling really inspired by [this post](%2DPa7quCfTU4UwPExIaU4FgIHiWOcN+BJtmQL1jQF9M=.sha256) by [@cryptix](@p13zSAiOpguI9nsawkGijsnMfWmFd5rlUNpzekEE+vI=.ed25519) and thinking about the incredible lake of knowledge that we have on Scuttlebutt. I can think of a handful of folks whose brains I'd love to pick, and I'm wondering whether others feel the same way. Or maybe there's already some sort of similar structure that already exists on Scuttlebutt? If so, I'd love to hear about it.",
