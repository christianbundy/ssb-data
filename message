My experience in the past has been that lots of friends end up staying up late or getting up really early just to make the calls, and my concern is that it isn't sustainable to ask people to do that regularly. My hope is that the smaller interval will decrease the FOMO and negative feelings about missing a call, but maybe this interval has reduced the FOMO too much. 😁\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, I was judging the interval based on the dates I posted above, and figured I'd only make it to two or three of the six calls. Maybe I'll put double effort into attending the even-numbered calls, *or* we can mess with the interval as needed. No attachment to the current system!\r\n\r\n> [...] or does it just ignore their existence, the way UNIX time normally does?\r\n\r\nOops! I think it ignores their existence. Everyone please set your clocks back... 36 seconds? It's wild that small changes over long periods of time are either *impossibly huge* or *impossibly small*. I wish I could develop an intuition about these sorts of things but \"2 ms over 50 years\" could either be seconds or months until I actually do the math.",
