The downside of deleting messages is that you can no longer verify the entire feed (since you lack the data), but the database doesn't try to re-validate feeds so it doesn't cause problems.\n\n[@cryptix](@p13zSAiOpguI9nsawkGijsnMfWmFd5rlUNpzekEE+vI=.ed25519) has been doing tons of great work on an alternative feed format that lets us delete messages without breaking feed verification, but the JS-SSB stack doesn't support other feed types yet (although PRs are open and moving in that direction).\n\n#ssb-dev",
