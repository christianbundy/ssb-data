Flash forward to 2020... They named it COVID19. Our leaders of world health predicted millions would die. The National Guard was deployed. Makeshift hospitals were erected to care for a massive overflow of patients. Mass graves were dug. Terrifying news reports had people everywhere seeking shelter to avoid connect. The plan is unfolding with precision. But the masters of the Pandemic underestimated one thing... the people.\r\n\r\nPlease stop spamming SSB, especially with anti-vaxx conspiracy baloney. I don't want YouTube to be the gatekeepers for the internet, but I *also* don't want my computer to be the garbage dump for every video that's been deleted from YouTube.\r\n\r\nDisinformation is incredibly dangerous and I'm not comfortable hosting it.",
