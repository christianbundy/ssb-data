    "text": "# My internet is down: the thread\n\nI've mentioned it a few times in the past few hours, but I think this event deserves its own thread. My phone still has internet, so this honestly shouldn't count, but this is the first time my home internet has gone down for more than a few minutes while I've been active on Scuttlebutt. I've had a handful of thoughts that I wanted to record ([example](%3IOki9gecZ0aPLA/Fi+1QH0m4hi8gwuyUrszuX9UHhk=.sha256)) but hesitant to post new threads for each of them.\n\nOne of the first things I've noticed in general is how much of my general knowledge depends on the internet. I think being always-online I've learned to forget things immediately after reading them, so without the internet I don't even have a way to check how to spell a word. I have some music that I purchased from Bandcamp, which is great, but I'm more in the mood for a podcast right now. I've often used devdocs.io as a language/framework reference, but the site doesn't seem to be working offline. Maybe I turned the setting off?\n\nAlso, if this was a multi-day or multi-week internet outage I'd be super bummed that I didn't archive more content from the web. I think a Wikipedia archive would be my first preference, but even on Scuttlebutt we reference lots of online-only resources. I remember that [@André Staltz](@+UMKhpbzXAII+2/7ZlsgkJwIsxdfeFi36Z5Rk1gCfY0=.ed25519) mentioned that in [this thread](%Lxcf72M/81ApRt3vKY5hqwDZ7XZ4ifp6cfMSEASWdFg=.sha256), but I'm more interested in it now that I'm offline(ish).",
