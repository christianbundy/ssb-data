I love it. It's impressive how clearly you're able to strike a tone and stick with it, regardless of whether that's *Zach Mandeville* or Sam's dad discussing responsible drug use.\n\nI spent a lot of time clicking and a *ton* of time scrolling, but my favorite page is still your [about](https://coolguy.website/about-me/index.html). You're witty and strong and vulnerable and *hilarious* and it evokes this strong \"ZACH IS THE FUTURE\" vibe that I can't really explain. I'm barely even awake this morning but already tempted to deep-dive into coolguy.website again and see what else I can find. I love it, thank you for sharing this with the world.\n\nOh, and the new website is lovely. âœ¨",
