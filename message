If panic buying continues I could imagine grocery stores implementing some rationing, but in my head we're in for a few months of physical distancing before things start to return to the status quo.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that US hospitals will soon look like hospitals and Italy, and while we're doing our best to flatten the curve I think that healthcare workers are going to be in for a really rough time. I'd love to know ways that we can support them.\r\n\r\nTwo big unknowns for me:\r\n\r\n- Mass unemployment? Lots of people work in service industries that don't seem like they'll remain open for long, and I'm concerned about what that will look like. - How will this change how we do elections in the US? The presidential primaries are happening now, but I'm unclear on whether this will still be happening in November or how it could change our election process.",
