    "text": "So I think I'm getting close to a Master Plan.\r\n\r\n- replace npm with git submodules\r\n- git submodules URL uses git-remote-helper\r\n- helper implements three behaviors:\r\n  - download packfile\r\n    - join swarm\r\n    - report HEAD and request packfile\r\n    - someone else will generate packfile for you\r\n  - show branches\r\n    - signed Git branches from upstream and friends\r\n    - merge whichever patches you want\r\n    - everyone is running closely related software\r\n  - seed in the background for others\r\n\r\nOnce we have that we've solved 90% of package management, now we'd just need to run `./configure && make` and we should be able to build our entire stack from source. Bonus points for specifying the hash of pre-built binaries (REPRODUCIBLE BUILDS) and skipping builds if the dependency is pre-installed.",
