It's mostly great, but has a few quirks that seem like a great opportunity for a future theme architecture.\r\n\r\n## Good\r\n\r\nFirst off, it's awesome to be able to support dozens of themes with only a few CSS variables. A gradient of eight shades from the background color to the foreground color plus eight colors. It's wonderful and simple and works really well most of the time.\r\n\r\n## Bad\r\n\r\nLet's pretend we're using a light theme: the background is white-ish, the foreground (text) is black-ish. **How close should colors be?** Some themes make the second-lightest color an incredibly light gray, whereas others make super dark. This leads to super questionable contrast, especially in themes like *cupcake* where everything is basically the same color.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of colors, **base16 is agnostic about colors**. Instead of saying \"color `n` should have a hue of `n / 360`\" they just refer to the semantics of the thing it's highlighting:\r\n\r\n> - base08 - Variables, XML Tags, Markup Link Text, Markup Lists, Diff Deleted\r\n> - base09 - Integers, Boolean, Constants, XML Attributes, Markup Link Url\r\n> - base0A - Classes, Markup Bold, Search Text Background\r\n\r\nSure, themes like *green-screen* should probably make everything a different shade of green, but it would be great if every other theme could at least agree on which variable is red. Even worse, some themes use **the same color for multiple color names**, so which highlights the fact that this is meant for syntax highlighting rather than general interface colors.\r\n\r\n## Future\r\n\r\nI don't know whether I'll ever have time for this, but *really* I'd love something similar to base16 with:\r\n\r\n- accessible contrast between shades\r\n- consensus on which color has which hue (except for background and foreground)\r\n- different shades of colors, for elements like a yellow info box that should have a border that's a *different* shade of yellow\r\n- maybe reuse the same colors for both light mode and dark mode, like how [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) does it\r\n- maybe a theme generator that lets you define color points and curves between them, like [colorbox](https://www.colorbox.io/)",
