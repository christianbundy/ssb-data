Copyright trolls could use this to sue us for distributing their data without a license, but getting informed and explicit consent would make this way simpler in general.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm down to have my messages shared far and wide on any medium, but it sounds like other folks are against having their messages available over public HTTP. Other friends are fine with public HTTP and really want to avoid being indexed by a search engine. It seems like long-term lots of people are interested in a system where we only replicate your content within `n` hops of people you follow, that way SSB content can't be spidered at all.\r\n\r\nI guess my point is that all of these desires are in the same problem-space of how we share our data with our friends and what we want them to do with that, and while \"do whatever you want with my data\" is simple I doubt it's actually the position taken by most butts. I think that we should probably codify the default value and give people options for how they can express their requests.",
