I love your website, it's beautiful and full of fun links.\r\n\r\nI think I originally got into SSB because I was doing wilderness search and rescue and was super interested with how mesh networks would intersect with the politics of decentralized power, but I stayed around because I felt really at home among friends. I'd had positive experiences on Twitter, Mastodon, etc., but nothing's ever clicked the same way.\r\n\r\nThe tech is cool, but really I'm here for the people.\r\n\r\nðŸŒ±",
