You can easily consume only the latest messages, and it won’t matter that you missed two consecutive “yes”, or two consecutive “no”.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of a parallel thread in [this SSB-DB pull request](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-db/pull/275#issuecomment-562236232)\r\n\r\n> I'm tempted to suggest that muxrpc could resolve this by supporting a special \"debounce-able source\" or something, since the debounce timing is based on the round-trip latency, but I don't think we need to optimize it yet.\r\n\r\nIs there a name for streams where only the latest value matters? I'm confident this is an established pattern with a name, but I can't remember what it might be.",
