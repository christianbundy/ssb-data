I'll take a look at that.\r\n\r\nI like that the C4 process adds some licensing constraints that explicitly disallow proprietary dual-licensing and such:\r\n\r\n> The project SHALL use a share-alike license such as the MPLv2, or a GPLv3 variant thereof (GPL, LGPL, AGPL).\r\n\r\n> All patches are owned by their authors. There SHALL NOT be any copyright assignment process.\r\n\r\nSeems reasonable to me: you can get a proprietary license as long as you get consent from every contributors, but otherwise you need to use the same license as everyone else. ðŸ¤·",
