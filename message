I noticed you're validating the `key`, but it might save you a bit of trouble if you just derive that rather than accept and validate it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've been putting together a [big list of troublesome messages](https://github.com/christianbundy/node-ssb-validate-example/blob/76094bfcac9e6af73cc3099af4526cb83c0840d8/fixtures/messages.json) that you might find useful. Either way, please feel free to ping me if you bump into any other trouble -- I've got lots of this fresh in my head since I was working on it over the weekend.",
