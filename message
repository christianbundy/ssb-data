Right now I've got:\n\n- square tiles on a donut-shaped world\n- random map generation with water, ocean, land, forest, mountains, settlements, units\n- arrow keys to move around the donut world\n- settlements create units that walk around until they die\n\nAgain, the code is *really bad*, but if you want you can click around [here](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/thin-manchego?path=script.js:0:0). I'll probably rewrite it (probably with [hexagonal tiles](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/thin-manchego?path=script.js:0:0)) or just completely forget about it, but I've sunk a few hours into it and I like sharing weird experiments.\n\n![Screenshot of green, blue, and white tiles forming a randomly generated map of continents and islands and such.
