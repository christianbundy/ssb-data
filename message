    "text": "I mentioned that I was working on a Solarized theme a while ago, and after accidentally deleting it (!) I got to start over again. This time I'm working on implementing [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16), so it should be *super simple* to switch theme colors without any pain. I've still got quite a bit left to do, but here's what it looks like now:\n\n![base16 solarized light theme for patchbay](&UNIWQDOMqxF996ESeiKLUuh36FyIdfq9M6qyo1iiYHs=.sha256)\n\n![base16 solarized dark theme for patchbay](&aLXtjJKL76D6iUgZ5VwLR4m2cz2b1SmCbOgIPSgZRp0=.sha256)\n\nThe sweet thing is that I can switch between these with only a few variable changes, which should make future iterations super simple. It's also really easy on the eyes, so I've got that going for me which is nice.",
