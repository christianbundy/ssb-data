    "text": "Yeah, the issue is that all of the results are diet podcasts and \"lose weight fast\" type stuff. IIRC this podcast had nothing to do with any specific diet, but one of their guests was talking about brain chemistry and went on a tangent about the effects of a diet (I think keto) on brain chemistry and it was really interesting to listen to. I've tried a few different podcast search engines but everything looks like the above screenshot. I wish I could remember what the podcast was called, because the \"primal\" thing just wades deeper into the fad diet scene."
