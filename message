Maybe it would be best to just loudly deprecate a package that's under-funded? At least in the npm ecosystem deprecated packages output a custom deprecation warning from the developer, which might be a good place to explain \"this package is under-funded and should not be used for production; this project is frozen until we can crowdfund a maintenance budget\".\n\nIf the developers are asking for some unreasonable funding then I think it makes sense to fork the project, but otherwise I'd imagine that it would be very expensive. Hiring a team to maintain an unfamiliar codebase is hard, and solidarity-minded folks in our community would hopefully refuse to work on projects with a reasonable maintenance budget.",
