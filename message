I haven't done much thinking about it, but HTML seems to work well enough on the rest of the web. I'm imagining a system where you can write in Markdown, RST, or whatever you'd like, but the end result is posted to your feed as HTML. When viewing messages you'd need to [sanitize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sanitize-html#what-are-the-default-options), but I think every implementation is rending as HTML anyway.",
