I understand that *once you give someone a link* then they'll be able to view your content, but is it possible to find hackmd posts *without* anyone publishing a link? For example, if I make a new hackmd and don't share it with anyone, will anyone be able to find it?\n\nI'm writing up a short note for a friend where I'm listing my personal phone number, but I don't want internet randos to be able to find the note. I've logged in with GitHub, if that's useful.\n\n#hackmd ",
