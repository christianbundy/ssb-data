I want local communication to keep the front seat in ssb.\r\n\r\nCould you expand on this a bit? In my mind, SHS in an authenticated key exchange, similar to a Diffie-Hellman, and I don't think my pre-coffee brain is connecting the dots on internet vs local.\r\n\r\nI also want local replication, I was thinking that would be as easy as listening on some localhost port and then doing a multicast like how we're currently doing it.",
