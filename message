I think the simplest deployment would be to add a special string suffix in `msg.value.content`. Instead of [requiring](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-validate/blob/4543058ee3cc67054edaaccdb53c9a5e6d72a569/index.js#L7-L8) that strings end with `.box` or `.sig` we could use `.sha256` or similar to link to the hash of the off-chain content. For example, diverging as little as possible from the current style:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"content\": \"i5DGedMC58Wdp2EFco9zqvbhN6KvXbG7tmmeKTro6LI=.sha256\"\n}\n```\n\n> What happens if replicate with a peer that doesn’t have the off-chain content?\n\nPeers that don't support off-chain content would see these off-chain messages as invalid, which removes the risk of replicating messages without content. Peers that haven't upgraded would only have on-chain messages, and as soon as they upgrade they'd get all of the new now-valid messages.\n\n> How do you differentiate between actual “deleted” content and a peer without the content?\n\nRight, this is a hard problem to solve. Instead of trying to support partial replication or peers without content, I think we should require that peers replicating a message **must** send either:\n\n- the content that corresponds to that message\n- a signed deletion request from the feed's author that corresponds to that message\n\nIn this system peers replicating feeds would be required to replicate *all* content that hasn't been deleted by the author, which means that peers can't selectively censor message content from a feed.",
