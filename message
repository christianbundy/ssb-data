I haven't made up my mind, but my preference right now would be to aim for compatibility with (dependencies in sub-lists):\r\n\r\n- Keys and identities\r\n- Feeds\r\n- Blobs (not blob replication)\r\n- Private messages\r\n\r\nThis probably means removing compatibility for:\r\n\r\n- FlumeDB\r\n- Multiserver\r\n- MuxRPC\r\n- Pull-Stream\r\n- Secret-Stack\r\n- Secret-Handshake\r\n\r\n*Anyway*, I think that supporting holes in an author's feed is a good change -- this is something  that [@cinnamon](@fBS90Djngwl/SlCh/20G7piSC064Qz2hBBxbfnbyM+Y=.ed25519) and I have discussed a lot, and they've convinced me that it's really Not That Bad. I don't think I have any more volunteer energy to pour into FlumeDB/MuxRPC/etc. I'm happy to cheer you on in your experiments though. ðŸŒŸ",
