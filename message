They want me to replace my SQL database with their blockchain? Big hmm.\r\n\r\nI wonder how they authenticate writes? It seems like you could get most of these benefits by letting anyone read from your database and make replicas, I'm not sure what the blockchain is for.\r\n\r\nAlso: I haven't had my coffee yet, so I might be more grumpy than appropriate. :~)",
