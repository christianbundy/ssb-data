How does patchwork handle this on a fresh install ?\r\n\r\nYeah! I use a branch of my `fix-flumelog-offset` module that fixes the timestamps, but Piet wrote a cool solution in Rust too!\r\n\r\n> Any ideas of what is going on here, and how to possibly replicate it ?\r\n\r\nI have a hunch that [this problem](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-ooo/issues/9) might be related. Messages downloaded out-of-order were being passed incorrectly which caused tons of errors in Oasis. Patchwork throws fewer errors, but I think it still has side-effects from the underlying bugs.\r\n\r\nI'd be curious to see if this happens with the latest version of ssb-ooo installed. Maybe we'll see during the next Patchwork update?",
