For example, I've just tested your extension repository and can confirm that these two work:\r\n\r\n- urn:message:sha256:g3hPVPDEO1Aj_uPl0-J2NlhFB2bbFLIHlty-YuqFZ3w=\r\n- tel:message:sha256:g3hPVPDEO1Aj_uPl0-J2NlhFB2bbFLIHlty-YuqFZ3w=\r\n\r\nThese don't work:\r\n\r\n- dat:message:sha256:g3hPVPDEO1Aj_uPl0-J2NlhFB2bbFLIHlty-YuqFZ3w=\r\n- ssb:message:sha256:g3hPVPDEO1Aj_uPl0-J2NlhFB2bbFLIHlty-YuqFZ3w=\r\n- dweb:message:sha256:g3hPVPDEO1Aj_uPl0-J2NlhFB2bbFLIHlty-YuqFZ3w=\r\n\r\nTo me, this smells like a browser bug, and it feels bad to throw a bunch more effort into the URI standardization process before we have some idea of what the actual problem is.\r\n\r\nOn a meta note, I don't want to assume the role of 'gatekeeper for URI changes'. If you feel comfortable that you've followed some RFC process and gotten some kind of approval then you're welcome to announce a breaking change to the URI scheme. I'm just one stakeholder, and I'm waving the \"identify the problem before solving it\" flag, but I'm happy to be the minority and I don't want to stand in the way of improvements.",
