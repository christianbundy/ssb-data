When I try to run that through `decodeURIComponent()` it's telling me that it's an invalid URI sequence.\r\n\r\nFWIW there's a bug in SSB-Markdown that I just found that can mess with some SSB references, I've reported it in Oasis and SSB-Markdown and started a fix, but I ran out of steam and just posted my diff as a comment.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/fraction/oasis/issues/242\r\n\r\n(It's wild how fast I can run out of energy when working on a problem. On one hand it's annoying, but on the other hand there's no mistaking when my programming time is over for the day.)",
