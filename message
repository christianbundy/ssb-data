Maybe it was when I was interested in municipal mesh networks? Now I'm curious how I got started on SSB too...\r\n\r\n> I can only imagine how yâ€™all handle setting up mesh networks out there.\r\n\r\nI think there's a bunch of opportunity there, but the group I was with just used VHF radios, relaying messages manually if groups couldn't reach each other *or* using an [inReach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_emergency_notification_device#inReach) if we really needed to chat with someone.\r\n\r\nYou might dig [disaster.radio](https://disaster.radio/), if you haven't already seen it.",
