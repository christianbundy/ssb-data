    "text": "I'm probably about done for the day, so to summarize I've:\n\n- Opened a small PR to expose flume's map to secure-scuttlebutt.\n- Opened a small-ish PR to expose flume's map to Scuttlebot and its plugins. \n- Moved the entire ssb-blob-content package to [its own repo](https://gitlab.com/christianbundy/ssb-blob-content).\n- Replaced multiblob with ssb-blobs.\n- Triggered `blobs.want()` for hashes we want.\n- Triggered `blobs.push()` for hashes we have.\n  - This is a hack and should eventually be added to some publish function.\n\nAssuming that those pull requests are merged without too many gigantic changes, this means the next steps for full #blob-content integration would be:\n\n- Writing a tests to ensure it *really* works.\n- Including the plugin in a client for read-only access.\n- Exposing a method to publish content blobs via Scuttlebot.\n- Adding an interface or settings for users to choose to publish blob content.\n\nThe only weirdness I've found has been centered around blobs you *don't* have: `sbot get $key` seems to hang until the blob is downloaded, which doesn't seem ideal. On the other hand, I think blobs are replicating just fine, which is really neat to see.",
