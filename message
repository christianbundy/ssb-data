Maybe that might be another way to do it: reference the exact SHA256 hash of the content you're referencing and don't let the viewer display any content that hasn't been referenced.\r\n\r\nThat way you can share a message (or a sequence of messages) with a friend over a public viewer, but they can't crawl the social graph by looking at irrelevant messages in the thread or traversing a hashtag or anything like that.",
