I was still dead after drinking two cups.\r\n\r\nI checked the bag: decaf. Also it expired in 2018.\r\n\r\nWe went to a drive-thru coffee shop but their hygiene was super questionable. No masks, no gloves, no hand washing, lots of shared surfaces (pen, clipboard, etc), and they went directly from touching someone's debit card to putting our straws in.\r\n\r\nWent to a grocery store to get hi-balls. It did the trick, but it took three attempts.\r\n\r\nVery happy to be home and drinking our own coffee.\r\n\r\n#coffee",
