You'll often receive all of the messages from one person before receiving any messages from someone else, so the order is all messed up.\r\n- **Sorting messages by the timestamp asserted by the author** sucks because sometimes people fabricate their timestamp (\\*cough\\* [@cryptix](@p13zSAiOpguI9nsawkGijsnMfWmFd5rlUNpzekEE+vI=.ed25519) \\*cough\\* ðŸ™ƒ) and sometimes their computer clocks are incorrect and the honor system is not a cryptographic primitive.\r\n- **Sorting messages based on their references to each other** sucks less, because if message B references message A then it *must* have been published afterward. We use this sorting in threads, but it would be great to use everywhere.\r\n\r\n[Here's my favorite visualization](https://public-rdsdavdrpd.now.sh/) of the concept, using a system where each message references two previous messages. In Scuttlebutt each of our messages reference *at least* the previous message that we published, and when we reference another message (like my reply to you!) we gain a data point to sort our messages better.",
