I've been carrying a handheld touchscreen computer around for about a dozen years ([my first](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch)) and I'm not sure I'd like to do it anymore. I think they're incredibly overrated, as anything that can be done on my \"phone\" can be done better as a separate device:\n\n- screen\n- camera\n- antennas\n- computing\n- networking\n- audio input and output\n\nWhy are we packing all of this into one device? I've got my computer in my backpack with me most of the time, and the only reason I have cell phone service is to get mobile data. My laptop can get mobile data, and I'm sure I can hook it up to a phone number and an antenna 10x better than my phone's antenna. What else do I need? I'm sure I can find a cheap camera somewhere, and the only thing I'm missing is a way to get a hold of me.\n\nMost of the time someone is trying to get a hold of me it isn't an emergency, and there's no rush for me to check my phone and reply. On the other hand, sometimes it *is* an emergency and it's important to me that I have a device that tells me \"psst get on your computer\". My original thought was to get a small cell phone that I can check ever so often, but I'm not excited about the fragility and privacy-hostile nature of modern cell phone networks. What's the alternative?\n\n![yellow hack the planet pager (beeper) vaporwave with zero cool](&CMFDh9d2Gkd5RYkiO+s6Pjsac98rqiBT58n1pxLKRpo=.sha256)\n\nHow are modern pagers not a thing? I'm sure there are a handful of *ironic* pagers, but that's not what I'm talking about. Given the above example where you have a computer in your backpack and a hefty antenna, why doesn't my computer just send me an alert when something urgent happens? A loud beep from my backpack might be a bit strange, but I'm sure you could DIY a low-energy pager that connects every so often over Bluetooth. Hell, maybe it can connect to *other pagers* to peer with them and act as a [PMD](%FVpLDnycNuviWez67KYqd8eVbDimRf1xDrbPUzqq9os=.sha256).\n\nAs far as I can see, there are no downsides:\n\n- higher quality\n- less expensive\n- easier to repair or replace parts\n- no loss to reachability as urgent messages are still delivered\n- loose feature coupling, more modular than any \"modular phone\"\n\nUnless I'm missing something major, I'm really not sure we need smartphones.
