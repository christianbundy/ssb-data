I'm really not great at reading IETF docs so my confidence is about 30%, but I'm reading about [query strings](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.4) that have the format:\n\n```abnf\nquery = *( pchar / \"/\" / \"?\" )\n```\n\nI don't know what `pchar` represents (printed characters?), but here's what I'm seeing the [the appendix](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#appendix-A):\n\n```abnf\nunreserved  = ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\" / \".\" / \"_\" / \"~\"\npct-encoded = \"%\" HEXDIG HEXDIG\nsub-delims  = \"!\" / \"$\" / \"&\" / \"'\" / \"(\" / \")\"\n            / \"*\" / \"+\" / \",\" / \";\" / \"=\"\npchar       = unreserved / pct-encoded / sub-delims / \":\" / \"@\"\n```\n\nIf I'm reading this right, I *think* this means we can just stick multiserver addresses in a query string and be done with it. If so, this seems like some great baby steps to iterate from where we are today:\n\n- Simple URI scheme for `<sigil><integer>.<alg>`-style messages.\n- Clickable multiserver addresses without any structural changes.\n\nThis means that the only change necesary would be a URI-safe base64:\n\n```\nssb:?multiserver=net:wx.larpa.net:8008~shs:DTNmX-4SjsgZ7xyDh5xxmNtFqa6pWi5Qtw7cE8aR9TQ=\n```\n\nIt sounds like non-modern pub invites won't make the cut, do we know what the status on DHT invites are? Are those all valid multiserver addresses, or is it an ad-hoc syntax that we'll want to wrangle as well? Hopefully my read of the URI spec is correct! Otherwise we'll likely need to use a more verbose solution.",
