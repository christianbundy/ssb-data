    "text": "I was feeling inspired after seeing %rkbS8WmY2MYzPl1kmEufaFhunrkybZRQntgeUMo/VxQ=.sha256 and %Ddr+z/anUPFdcTQNqv4sWGPw8mzoMsT/IzptYTltoBI=.sha256, so I ended up making a hummus pita pizza from scratch.\n\n![IMG_20180716_175608.jpg](&z26sN5h7eisRMQ5S1i7L1/DU/zW4oNYyhENWhY5NidY=.sha256)\n\nThe hummus ended up being super easy (and cheap!), I made it from dried chickpeas plus some cashews that had been soaking for a few days; I was going to use the cashews for a pizza a few days ago but I didn't have yeast at the time. It's *super* tasty, plus I had a lot of opportunities to season it however I wanted. I looked up about 10 recipes and then just freestyled it with what I had in the fridge.\n\nThe pita was great -- I followed [@elektron](@hTXM9yV6EZ6nXcT3QopcwhSWrC008EnaGhoo/UNzX3g=.ed25519)'s recipe but instead of divvying it into eight pitas I just split it into two pitas with 4x thickness. I probably could've gone thinner, but I only let it rise for about 10 minutes (I know) and I wasn't sure how it'd be.\n\nThe toppings were pretty easy: onions, mushrooms, broccoli, and some sesame seeds on a thick layer of hummus. Highly recommend, and after a huge portion for both myself and my girlfriend we still have about half of the pita and toppings and around 80% of the hummus still left in the fridge.\n\nShout out to [@kemitchell](@TqlPr31FOOCjuupH0L9HCJdLjWYySyibbKscNhgLoCo=.ed25519)\nfor https://miseenbag.com/ which inspired me to cook something from scratch tonight. \n\n \n#vegan #food #cooking #cooking-channel #recipes",
