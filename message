In practice, it's usually something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n┌ → B → ┐\r\n|       ↓\r\nA       C\r\n|       ↑\r\n└ → D → ┘\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf Bob blocks Carol, Alice still has a route to Carol through Dan. If *all* routes to Carol are blocked, then Alice will no longer see Carol, but as long as there's  a path between them and Carol is within Alice's replication distance then the intermediary blocks don't matter in a technical sense.\r\n\r\nSocially, Alice might distance herself from Carol when she notices that Carol is getting blocked for various reasons, but that's another story.",
