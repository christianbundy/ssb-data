This is a bit hard to do, since you'd have to do something like:\r\n\r\n- copy your key to multiple devices\r\n- publish different [valid] messages at the same time\r\n- replicate those messages to different servers\r\n\r\nNow when some server with fork A connects to a server with fork B they won't replicate your messages, but *usually* what happens is:\r\n\r\n- copy your key to multiple devices\r\n- publish a valid message with one device\r\n- replicate that message across the network\r\n- publish a different message on the other device\r\n- try to replicate that message, but fail because they already have the first message\r\n- keep publishing messages and be confused why people can't see you\r\n- re-download your feed from the network\r\n- congrats your fork is gone!\r\n\r\n",
