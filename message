In fact it’s a whole lot like trudging from one place to another, across uneven terrain, only precariously balanced at the best of times. And yet everything, *everything*, depends on it.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure that I would've picked up on this if I hadn't read your comment here, but this ethos really made the game for me. I keep thinking that maybe there's a way to build something similar in a way that helps people in our non-fiction universe.\r\n\r\nMost people want to help most people, but without feedback loops it's difficult to tell whether you're making a difference. I think *likes* might be an unreasonably shallow metric, but I think we'd see a lot more spontaneous generosity and reciprocity if we knew we were making a difference.\r\n\r\nEven SSB, for example: how many messages have I passed?  Is my pub server useful for people? Would our network still operate without Internet? How far can I send a message without Internet access? How long does it take? Which people and infrastructure does that communication depend on? Do all of those people have enough resources to take care of themselves? How can I distribute my excess resources if others don't have enough?\r\n\r\nI don't have answers, but I'm hopeful that maybe we'll figure them out.",
