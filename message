I've transitioned from showering every morning and using a ton of product to just shaving my head and treating my scalp hair like my facial hair (that is, shaving it to the bone), but I'm wondering whether there's some non-shitty system someone else uses for low-maintenance hygiene and grooming without looking like a skinhead.\n\nDon't even get me started on how easily my scalp burns in the sun. No bueno.\n\nI'm sure there's an appropriate channel for this, but I don't know what it is. Maybe:\n\n- #grooming\n- #hair\n- #hygiene\n- #diy\n- something else? ",
