Manyverse processes the `expression` [here](https://gitlab.com/staltz/manyverse/-/blob/ae7211b908584c8f723f2d807f5a75de86dddf38/src/frontend/ssb/utils/from-ssb.ts#L25-37), but I'm trying to understand which other values I can pass to have it displayed in Manyverse (and other clients that provide compatibility).\r\n\r\nDisplaying these reactions is new behavior, and I like it, but I can't make a compatible implementation unless we have a spec. If it's just a string then I'd expect that I can post an `expression` like \"lol this is really funny, thanks for posting this meme!\" and have it show up in Manyverse/etc, which I'm guessing (?) is not a promise we want to make.",
