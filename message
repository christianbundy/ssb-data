I bet that moderating people who care a bunch about p2p and distributed systems is especially difficult. For what it's worth, lidel seems great and I don't want to give the impression that I think they've done anything wrong. This ended up being a nice entry point to chat with them a bit about P2P.\r\n\r\nI think I'm wary of separating *how can we do X* with *should we do X*, and would disagree that the latter is \"off-topic\", but I don't expect you to run your website according to my personal preferences. ‚ù§\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for the message. I'll keep investigating some of the specs you all have been writing and be on the lookout for places we might intersect.",
