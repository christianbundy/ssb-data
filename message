We don't need any servers to stay online, we don't need admins to block unfriendly people, and it's much easier to have friendly disagreements when you don't need consensus.\r\n\r\nIt's like groceries: you can shop at a big capitalist grocery store like Walmart, you can buy from your local food co-op, *or* you can plant seeds in your backyard and help your friends and family do the same. I think of SSB/Cabal as planting your own seeds and helping others do the same, federated protocols like ActivityPub/Matrix are like a local food co-op, and concentrated power silos like Twitter/Slack are like Walmart.\r\n\r\nI don't believe in One Protocol To Rule Them All, and I'm on Mastodon because I want to plant my own seeds *and* support the local food co-op, but hopefully that makes some sense about what I'm personally interested in building. :)",
