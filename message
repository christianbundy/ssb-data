I wonder whether there's a name for this sort of thing, maybe it's an instance of a [mediator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern)? Usually the problem with those is that your mediator can get too deep and complex, but if we're literally just mediating URIs I think it might work? I'm not sure, but I'm happy you came up with a simliar idea!\n\nI don't know whether it'd be a good idea, but I suppose you could use something like depject for URI handlers... ðŸ¤¯",
