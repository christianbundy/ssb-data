Still, there are 13.596 files in that zip, thats quite a lot. ðŸ˜º\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about this in circles but I think I need more info: do you know what the bottleneck is? If it's literally just the Windows unzip utility then I can add the Golang unzip utility, if it's the file count then I can try a bundler (but all of them break from our native modules), or maybe it's the zip compression? I can disable the compression if that's the bottleneck, but it's hard to say. I've never had to debug a `.zip` before!",
