I'd love to hear more about that, I talked about [wanting a pager](%ev6LoTts1iZqCmUkAjSMvghE9WGj9VJZPWKTSABzPko=.sha256) a while ago but going completely phone-free sounds better. I think I might like a handheld radio though... ðŸ˜‰\n\nI should probably spend more time on scat, I've been on a few times but always forget to check it again. WebRTC should work too -- I'm slowly becoming disenchanted with Epiphany so I'm back to Firefox. I think I saw a thread about that and I'm like 80% sure I'll be there, which will be cool!",
