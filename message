I'm tracking it in Patchwork [here](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork/issues/1035).\n\nThe bug happens when you have multiple network interfaces, because multiserver arbitrarily (?) chooses one and broadcast it over the network. I'm working to fix it in [ssb-config](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-config/pull/53) but it's also broken in [multiserver](https://github.com/ssbc/multiserver/pull/48). Assuming you're running into the same bug as everyone else, that *should* get resolved if / when those pull requests are reviewed + merged.",
