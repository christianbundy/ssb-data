If you drop \"multifeed\" from the end of the command it will be less specific and should update *everything* while respecting semver and avoiding duplication when possible. I was also using that workaround until recently, but I think it was only really required between npm 5.0 and 5.1 before [this PR](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/17508) was merged.",
