    "text": "# Ask SSB: If you woke up tomorrow with a billion dollars in your bank account, how would you spend it?\r\n\r\nThis is purely a thought experiment, but I've been thinking about *moral ways to infuse money into a community*. Specifically, money that you don't deserve any more than your peers deserve it.\r\n\r\nThe most recent idea that I've got: keep 1% and donate 99% to some recipients, on the condition that they recursively do the same. You'd probably need some rules, like:\r\n\r\n- Your recipients can never know it came from you.\r\n- At some point the process should probably stop, maybe when 1% of the money you have is <= $100.\r\n\r\nTo be candid, this is a thought experiment about **p2p community budgeting**, which has been swirling around in my head for the last year or so. Money is hard, so I've been thinking about different implementations of giving and receiving ([and having and sharing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTjqz0_wsZo)).\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear any thoughts or ridiculous implementations you can think of.",
