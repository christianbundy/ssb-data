I just opened the plugin and it worked. If I remember correctly I had some trouble figuring out which remote I should add, maybe there's an easy way to add that to ssb-server/Patchwork so that you don't have to come up with that address manually. My issue was that Patchwork uses a unix socket so I had to hand-write  `net:` remote for Patchfox.\n\nI wish I remembered a bit better, it was a few weeks ago. I think it would be much simpler if Patchwork had a way to give you a remote *and* a way to export your keypair.",
