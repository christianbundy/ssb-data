They do a clever thing where they rotate the hue of the colors, which is unfortunate because we use those colors for semantics (blue = link, yellow = info, violet = private, etc), so there are a bunch of really great themes I've been avoiding.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit hesitant to open that can of worms, since I'd probably feel obligated to fix contrast ratios too, but maybe just the hue fixes is reasonable.",
