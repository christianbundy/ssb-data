It's like we were playing chess without allowing the king to move! I still don't really know what I'm doing, but I've been having a lot more fun now that the game makes a bit more sense.\n\nPerching the beetle on a bee seems like a great area denial strategy, but I'm still not sure *when* the bee should be placed. As soon as possible? As late as possible? I'm having a hard time developing an intuition for the early part of the game.",
