If it has problems you should see some \"falling back to JavaScript cryptography\" output in your terminal, which usually *very* slow.\r\n\r\nOasis is super slow on my phone, so I put together [this pull request](https://github.com/fraction/oasis/pull/250) to vastly reduce the amount of crypto I have to do -- could you try out that branch and see if it helps at all? Alternatively, you can wait for it to land in `master` if/when it's merged. Hopefully that solves the problem, but we can keep debugging if not!\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing out that it's super slow, that's really good info to have.",
