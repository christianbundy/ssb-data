Maybe there's some way to add a guard onto scissors? ðŸ¤· I use [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JNQSIQ), which cost $20 in 2013 and aren't specifically meant for your face, but my rechargeable facial hair trimmer gave out a few years ago and I can't justify buying another one when these clippers do the job.\r\n\r\nWhen these clippers give out it looks like there are [tons of other options](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-hair-clippers-for-home-use/), but some kind of non-electric contraption would be my preference.",
