Do you have any thoughts or resources that touch on the question of an optimal population density?\n\nOn one hand I see that living in a city which a high population density tends to increase walkability and has some efficiency benefits, but it also seems to mean that nobody can grow their own food and instead have a huge dependency on far-away farms and factories (plus the supply chains). I can't find a good answer, so I'm hoping you have one!",
