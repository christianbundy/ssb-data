    "text": "# ðŸ–§ Scuttlebutt Overlay Network\n\nA couple of years ago I became incredibly interested in mesh networks that could provide resilient connectivity without depending  on central servers. Scuttlebutt is great at resolving this asychronously with eventual consistency, but I wonder whether we could use Scuttlebutt as an overlay network like #cjdns. Have there been any discussions about this already?\n\nA few weeks ago [@rabble](@vzoU7/XuBB5B0xueC9NHFr9Q76VvPktD9GUkYgN9lAc=.ed25519) brought up the idea of using #tor for this, but it may be possible to add STUN/TURN to muxrpc instead. This would give us the ability to communicate through end-to-end encrypted tunnels, which lets us do sychronous stuff when we can connect (e.g. audio/video calls, real-time games, git, ssh, etc).\n\nI'd love to hear first impressions and thoughts about whether and how this might work.",
