Maybe someone knows what it's called?\r\n\r\nI was thinking about how [private groups](https://github.com/dominictarr/private-groups-paper) in SSB compare with private groups in real life, and the problems of repudiation. If your partner leaks a sensitive message, your signature (and the chain of previous signatures) makes it impossible to say \"I didn't write that\".\r\n\r\nIs it possible to build an append-only cryptographic system that still gives us repudiation? Maybe!\r\n\r\n\r\n#crypto #ssb #private-groups",
