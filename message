Right now there's no difference between the two:\n\n- Alice follows Bob who follows Carol\n- Alice who follows 100 people who all follow Carol\n\nInstead of having the hop distance set at `1` or `2`, I wonder whether it'd be possible to set them at `1.5` or something, where the distance decreases as the number of connections increases. Or, if we can step past the concept of \"distance\", we'd be looking at something like [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) but for friends and trust.\n\n![PageRanks-Example.svg](&xXuPbeO0WUDa4KbGcn0arSFeFRFp9kNBvLewLnAq9a8=.sha256)\n\nPubs are certainly part of the problem, but I think that the essential problem is that following someone new carries the same weight regardless of whether you're following 9 people or 999 people.",
