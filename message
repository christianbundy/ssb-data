Is similarity to ActivityStreams valuable without going all the way and matching it exactly? I could be convinced of that.\n>\n> I like warning more than summary because it matches this use case more specifically but that‚Äôs not a huge deal.\n\nI don't think it's a problem since Markdown could be parsed as plaintext *or* rendered as HTML. I think that converging on a standard is a net positive even if we've got our own quirks, plus I'd really love to use it as a summary for non-warnings (e.g. \"browser javascript rant\" or \"ssbc governance\" or similar). Currently Scuttlebutt is dominated by a few topics and I'd love to share a summary so that people don't have to read about things they don't care about. \n\nEither way, I think this is a solid win. üëç ",
