    "text": "Hey [@Darius Kazemi](@VRAbRs/uMR2qdfiRNx2+1XRXePjJ75suZAmhGYZihks=.ed25519)!\n\nI think I originally came across your name while looking up local co-ops, and I was super into the [Feel Train](https://feeltrain.com/) website (and the Bojack reference, of course). I've got an itsy bitsy LLC for working with software systems that I'm trying to expand, and I thought your [document to start a tech cooperative](https://feeltrain.com/blog/operating-agreement/) was really inspiring.\n\nI'm surprised at the lack of bots on here, maybe you can help with that? I'm running [@Current Events](@wNmXqk80DL4FrBjzZcYqbKs/SpsPv6MVX6BLICabPfI=.ed25519) and constantly tempted to start a new SSB bot project.",
