Git is a great system for managing the state of a filesystem with an append-only log. Git-SSB is a great system for using Git via SSB, the only problem is that we don't have any protected branches.\r\n\r\nWe now want to manage a filesystem via SSB with protected branches, and are discussing different ways to do that, but I'm wondering whether this might be The Perfect Opportunity to add protected branches to git-ssb and solve both use-cases.\r\n\r\nEven a simple policy like \"commits to branches that start with `git-ssb-protected-*` will be ignored unless you're pushing to `git-ssb-protected-<your-feed-id>`\" would work fine, although it's a bit verbose. So if you checkout `git-ssb-protected-@alice.ed25519` you can be 100% sure that it was pushed by @alice.ed25519.\r\n\r\n> What would the different domains be? The same system hosted on different pubs? Or different applications/variations/structures?\r\n\r\nYeah, I was thinking the same system on different servers, although you could have a handful of different software systems implementing the same behavior.\r\n\r\n> Unless that feed can grant access to others.\r\n\r\nI think we're going to have to resolve the multi-writer problem in SSB as a whole before we'll be able to solve multi-writer in subsystems. I'd love to be wrong, but I think that any solution we could implement within the scope of a message type would probably work just fine *in general* and maybe should just be deployed to SSB.",
