    "text": "I bumped into the Gentoo handbook today and found a page called [Java/Why build from source](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Java/Why_build_from_source). Lots of it is specific to Java, but I saw a few bits I liked:\r\n\r\n> - Building from source ensures that the source exists and compiles properly, which is the basis of regular open-source development.\r\n> - Bugs may be found and fixed between upstream releases. By compiling from source, we are able to isolate patches to address such problems, without having to wait for upstream.\r\n> - When security flaws are found, we want to be able to issue fix as soon as possible. It is not always feasible to wait for the upstream project to make a new release. With binary-only packages, the only fix we can offer is disabling the software entirely by masking it.\r\n> - End-users may want to manually patch or tweak the sources between [unpacking] and [compiling].\r\n> - It is common that we need to apply [custom] tweaks and intermediary patches when upstream takes a long time to issue a new release, which is almost always only possible when we compile from sources.\r\n\r\n**How can we trust software that we can't even build from the original source repository?** I don't want a tarball of build artifacts, I want commit messages and diffs and changing package versions without touching the internet. Hell, I *really* want #git-bug or similar so I can keep track of all the relevant work going on in my upstream modules. Open source consumerism is super convenient but I think we're making trade-offs that aren't in our interests.",
