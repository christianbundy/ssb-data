I'd also be interested to hear your opinions on Unicode and #open-source font families like Noto, which happen to be *super extensive* but also *super developed and maintained by GOOG*. Are there better alternatives, or are there valid use-cases to ship Google fonts for accessibility? Cheers! üçª",
