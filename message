    "text": "Our kitty Sunshine has been vomiting a bunch lately and the vets don't have appointments for a week or two, so we took her to the local [emergency animal hospital](https://www.dovelewis.org/) out of abundance of caution.\r\n\r\nAll of her tests came back \"unremarkable\", which is good, but the covid-19 protocols meant that we had to stay in the car and our only communication with the vets was over the phone. (Of course, the veterinary technicians came out to the car to get Sunshine -- apparently they can't take blood samples over the phone.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, I had a fun exchange when filling out paperwork over the phone.\r\n\r\n- **Me:** Yeah, it's Bundy -- B-U-N-D-Y\r\n- **Them:** Is that B like 'boy, or D like 'dog'?\r\n- **Me:** B like 'boy'.\r\n- **Them:** Thanks!\r\n\r\nLater, when I check my email for paperwork I need to sign:\r\n\r\n> Hello, Christian Bunby!\r\n\r\nðŸ¤¦",
