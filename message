I'll start keeping track of maintenance activities starting on Monday and plan to continue for ~12 weeks, with a meeting after the first 4 weeks.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAside: I know that the Patchwork OpenCollective also has some funds that we could either use for maintenance or maybe even funding contributions? We don't have to dig into this now, maybe just something for everyone involved to consider. I'd really like to avoid hoarding cash in the OpenCollective, if possible, and I've really struggled at finding ways to spend it since it was sent over.",
