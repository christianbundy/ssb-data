It's super fun, and I'm really enjoying it so far.\r\n\r\nOne funny moment I've had: when Sam is in the private room he wears \"normal\" clothing, and the pants stand out to me and I think they're super cool. Dark gray soft-shell pants with articulated knees and a nice taper? I want them IRL. Eventually I decided to look them up, and *of course* there's [someone on Reddit with the same question](https://old.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/comments/eb5xrj/sams_pants/) and **of course** the clothing is designed by Errolson Hugh. I hate how much I love it.\r\n\r\nI swear I like the game more than I like Sam's pants, but I had to share that rabbit hole with someone.",
