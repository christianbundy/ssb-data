Installing from source worked for me, but unfortunately my computer isn't beefy enough to be able to run it. When editing files there were a few seconds of latency between keypress and the UI update, and my OS kept offering to force-quit the app because it was unresponsive.\r\n\r\nHopefully it's just a performance bug and when I try again later it'll work great. I'll continue to live vicariously through you all in this thread until then though! ðŸ‘€",
