    "text": "**How can we help folks who are houseless?** I'll often see people sleeping on the sidewalk during my walk to work, but lately I've seen the same guy charging his phone so I stopped to talk to him. I chat with him a few minutes every day, and I'm feeling frustrated and powerless to help him out. He's sleeping outside because he says the shelters have long lines and he'd have to pay to get a card that says he doesn't have tuberculosis. He wants to find some predictable income and often mentions that he wants to clean cars or sell water bottles or something, but I'm unsure how realistic it is.\n\nI've been able to find some temp agencies and such that might be able to help, but I'd imagine most jobs want someone who has clean clothes and a daily shower. The other part of me is frustrated that my only options are to suggest *other people* who might help him, but maybe that's the right thing to do? I'm sure I'm not the only one frustrated and feeling powerless, so I guess I'm looking for advice or solidarity or both.",
