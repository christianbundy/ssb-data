I think of the JS-SSB stack as a mad science experiment that was probably super fun to design and build, but now that we know that it works (ðŸŽ‰) we can replace the gourmet software with its boring counterpart.\r\n\r\nI think it makes the most sense to start at the front-end, and since Patchwork is built on similar experiments (Depject, Mutant, Micro-CSS, Hyperscript, etc) I've started a boring alternative (#oasis), and my hope is that over time it'll get more boring.\r\n\r\nMy holy grail is replacing FlumeDB with SQLite and replacing MuxRPC with HTTP or JSON-RPC or something, but it'll take some time to lay a new foundation.",
