Patchbay's version number hasn't been updated in a while, are you using the installer from the 7.13.1 release or building from source? Sorry for the barrage of questions.\n\n[@alanz](@ZcjYF92reFjUtEYdoJ8ulOI6N6klwAAaIkghEEHdvSE=.ed25519) \n\nIt looks like `npm ci` [landed](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/171556855892/introducing-npm-ci-for-faster-more-reliable) back in March, so I'm not sure it'll work if [@صفر](@uR5GhJwABZuZwhy9mI2hFYkTP0IMRG2LZkqpTkgcR1g=.ed25519) is running NPM 3.5.2. The worst part, in my opinion, is that the behavior of `npm install` was changed in NPM 5 to be incredibly similar to `npm ci`, but `npm ci` was released afterward as a \"strict mode\" for the new `npm install` behavior. I'd love to jump ship from NPM but I'm not sure I'd like to put all my eggs in Facebook's basket with Yarn.",
