Instead, how about this:\n\n**Any pull request or PR that hasn't had any activity in 6 months should be labeled *stale* and closed.**\n\nWe can iterate on this in the future, but it seems like a super easy win. Any objections? I don't want the emails either, but it seems like a small price to pay for the massive reduction in open issues."
