Maybe someone can give some good advice?\r\n\r\nI think my frustration is that we tend to zoom in on specific details (police reform, crime and punishment, sexism against men, racism against white people, etc) and we never get anywhere because these are just aspects of root ideological disagreements.\r\n\r\nI feel like we're focusing on symptoms instead of talking about the actual root disagreements. Is there a way to zoom out and talk about the root disagreements, or is this just the experience with disagreeing with family?",
