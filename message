    "text": "Software thoughts about Prettier.\r\n\r\nI've been using Prettier lately and really enjoying it. Anyone else have experience to share? I like that it auto-formats code from different languages in popular and accessible style dialects (stylects?). Some of these don't match my *personal* code style, but I think that's the point.\r\n\r\nHell, for code style enthusiasts it'd probably be trivial to create dialect-specific branches so you can develop on your favorite tree. As long as everyone converges on the same `master` it doesn't really matter whether anyone writes software in the same style.\r\n\r\n#prettier #software #style",
