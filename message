If you're running with Node.js you get an HTTP server, if you're running in a web browser you get a single page app. The important thing is that the application code doesn't know (or care) about which interface you're using.\r\n\r\nThe SPA code fixes links, so `href=\"/foo\" is changed to `href=\"#/foo` (which probably breaks non-relative links), and I need to implement some form capturing for HTTP POST support, but otherwise this little example implements most of the behavior I'm looking for. My problem is that I'm 99.999% sure I'm not the only person who has thought about this and I'd rather contribute to an existing project than starting my own little invention.",
