I cleaned as much as I could, but there's mildew in the insulation and dirty components I can't disassemble and I can't find any parts online. Maybe it's because it's so old, maybe it's because it runs on [R-22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorodifluoromethane), but I think we should probably just buy a new air conditioner.\n\nOn the other hand, cleaning this old air conditioner was great at driving home the fact that *I should regularly clean my next air conditioner* so that it never looks like this. We'll see whether that's as simple in practice as it is in theory.",
