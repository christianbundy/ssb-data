The last straw for me was [this message](%5fvsRxd7S0cQVA+Dvu3NmbeQDJerKgnYqyNVwYUynrE=.sha256) about [The Protocols of the Elders of Zion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion), which I've only seen circulated in antisemitic circles.\n\nI'm planning to block their feed, delete their content, and decrease my hops to 2.",
