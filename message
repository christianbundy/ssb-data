    "text": "# Oasis 2.15.0 -- Upgrade immediately\r\n\r\n- **Desktop:** [Oasis-Desktop](https://github.com/fraction/oasis-desktop/releases/latest) (New!)\r\n- **Terminal:** `npx global-install fraction/oasis#semver:`\r\n- **Terminal (unstable):** `npx global-install fraction/oasis`\r\n\r\nCheck out the [readme](https://github.com/fraction/oasis/blob/master/README.md) for more information and installation instructions.\r\n\r\n## Security\r\n\r\nThere's lots of fun stuff I want to talk about, but we need to get something out of the way first: **every version of Oasis before 2.15.0 has a security vulnerability and you need to upgrade immediately.** We don't have any reason to believe that this flaw was exploited in the wild, but we need to get everyone upgraded out of an abundance of caution. \r\n\r\nIf you're running a vulnerable application on your computer and an attacker can trick you into visiting a malicious website, they could use [DNS rebinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding) and [CSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) attacks to read/write to vulnerable applications. \r\n\r\n- **March 24:** [@Powersource](@Vz6v3xKpzViiTM/GAe+hKkACZSqrErQQZgv4iqQxEn8=.ed25519) suggests a security review and pings [@zozs](@S1h5yat/vRFUJw7ft5+U661/AblIZsdDCA6ZGOb7814=.ed25519).\r\n- **March 25:** I receive an email from [@zozs](@S1h5yat/vRFUJw7ft5+U661/AblIZsdDCA6ZGOb7814=.ed25519) disclosing these problems ðŸŽ‰\r\n- **March 26:** I write a patch for Oasis and reach out to other SSB interface developers who might have the same vulnerability.\r\n- **April 9:** [@cel](@f/6sQ6d2CMxRUhLpspgGIulDxDCwYD7DzFzPNr7u5AU=.ed25519) indicates that patches are ready for Patchfoo and Git-SSB-Web and [@Dominic](@EMovhfIrFk4NihAKnRNhrfRaqIhBv1Wj8pTxJNgvCCY=.ed25519) indicates that we shouldn't wait for him to write a patch for Yap.\r\n- **April 10:** Public disclosure. (You are here.) **If you use Oasis, Patchfoo, or Git-SSB-Web, you need to upgrade as soon as possible.**\r\n\r\nHuge thanks to everyone involved (especially [@zozs](@S1h5yat/vRFUJw7ft5+U661/AblIZsdDCA6ZGOb7814=.ed25519)!) for finding and fixing these problems. I'd like to organize some time to hunt for more security vulnerabilities throughout the stack, if anyone is interested in that sort of thing. ðŸ”¨\r\n\r\n\r\n## Added\r\n\r\n- Spanish translation (#307)\r\n- Patchbay info to FAQ (#327)\r\n- Theme config with existing mechanisms (#343)\r\n- Sticky post header (#348, #379)\r\n- TCP socket fallback (#352)\r\n- Threads view (#353, #378)\r\n- Tests and types (#363)\r\n- Italian translation (#367)\r\n- Block and unblock (#372)\r\n- Show who liked post (#377, #382)\r\n\r\n## Fixed\r\n\r\n- 'Popular navigation link (#309)\r\n- Thread labels (#310)\r\n- Text and label clarity (#310, #316, #317)\r\n- mkdirp race condition (#322)\r\n- Indexing error message (#325)\r\n- Crash when linking directly to private message (#335)\r\n- Settings ordering (#311)\r\n- Shift cards rather than indent (#337)\r\n- Channel appearing in non-root posts (#341)\r\n- Only show connected peers in settings (#342)\r\n- Text-based browser spacing issues (#348)\r\n- Markdown link bug (#356)\r\n- UI inconsistencies (#357)\r\n- Follow button for non-English languages (#360)\r\n- Popular posts being processed twice (#366)\r\n\r\nPlease reach out if you have any questions or if you need help upgrading.
