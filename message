So I suppose this new pool of money should have more limitations than the default money in the bank account of the recipient.\r\n\r\nIf I have $500 in my bank account and want to turn it into $1000, I could start a fundraiser for $1000 and then wait until it's halfway funded and then finish it off myself with a sybil attack. Even just \"all transactions with fundraiser money must make itemized receipts available to all fundraisers\", which means that I'd be spending $500 and some social capital to turn that into $1000 with lots of oversight. ðŸ¤”",
