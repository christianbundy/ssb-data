At midnight it's 0°, at noon it's 180°, and it slowly iterates through every hue in between.\n\n## Links\n\n- <https://timeclock.hashbase.io/>\n- <dat://timeclock.hashbase.io/>\n- <dat://136cb0594d89da97f7962e1c7c579cb06bfc6e32f6998f103d09e9caba00e426/>\n\n## Todo (maybe)\n\n- Use a variable font color for higher legibility\n- Figure out why it looks different in Firefox and Chromium (???)\n- Fix the line length, it looks really bad on a wide monitor",
