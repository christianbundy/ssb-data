    "text": "It looks like there was an article written about this last year that points out the need for server-side solutions:\n\n> Most networked applications, including SSB, solve this by connecting to publicly addressable servers. Sometimes P2P systems use clever techniques ([TURN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT), [STUN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN), [ICE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Connectivity_Establishment)) to reduce the role of the servers, but itâ€™s still necessary to have them.\n\nI wonder whether pubs could act as #TURN, #STUN, or #ICE servers between folks they follow. I'm thinking something like this:\n\n- Alice hosts a pub on her local network.\n- Bob wants to connect to Alice, but he can't get past Alice's router.\n- Both Alice and Bob mutually follow Carol's pub.\n- Carol offers to mediate their connection and hosts one of the above fixes.\n- Both Alice and Bob connect to Carol, who deploys TURN, and the they now have TCP connection.\n- Alice and Bob can gossip!\n\n![alice-bob-carol-router.png](&Sm3Lep/4s3nCnGlMT060ntMObbs+IXkcSYGJk1Rf0TI=.sha256)\n\n```dot\ndigraph g {\n  Bob -> Router [style=\"dashed\", label=\"fail\"];\n  Bob -> Carol -> Alice;\n  Alice -> Router -> Carol -> Bob;\n}\n```",
