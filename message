I just read through most the other chapters on Social Architecture and wanted to reach out to the author to discuss. I didn't realize that Pieter Hintjens was the author of *[A Protocol for Dying](http://hintjens.com/blog%3A115)*. I read *[Fighting Cancer](http://hintjens.com/blog:123)* when he published it and was sad to hear he died months later.\r\n\r\nRight now I have *[The Power of Living System](http://hintjens.com/blog:74)* open, any chance you could recommend anything of his after I'm done with that? I was also very interested to see the [ZeroMQ RFC](https://rfc.zeromq.org/), the list of protocols looks really great.",
