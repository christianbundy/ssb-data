I agree that we don't want to fork and maintain a bunch of modules, but out of the 505 files we `require()` only a few of them require non-strict parsing.\n\nFrom my perspective it seems like expressing modules in non-strict JavaScript would be like expressing JSON data as JavaScript. Sure, you can `module.exports = { \"foo\": \"bar\" }`, but it adds an unnecessary layer of complexity that I'd love to avoid. ðŸ¤·",
