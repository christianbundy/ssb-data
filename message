I've just tried it out, and noticed three small bugs:\r\n\r\n- In *Settings* I can select *sync data*, but it tells me that I need to input an onboard blob URL first. If I select one of the inputs and press *enter*, it works, so I'm guessing that there's something wrong with the form submission maybe?\r\n- When I hit *enter* I can confirm that the network request works perfectly, but unfortunately I get a `window.alert()` saying \"Timeout requesting blob\". It looks like the request is taking about 990 milliseconds.\r\n- Trying to publish a private message to myself throws \"`this.recipients.value` is undefined\", although I'm putting my ID in the recipient input field.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is way cool, and I'm really excited to see how this development goes!",
