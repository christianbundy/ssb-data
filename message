This is a good idea, and it's what we're currently doing, except that most people don't have a public IP address. This means that we need some intermediary servers on the internet _or_ some overlay network (yggdrasil, cjdns, tor, etc). I'm hopeful that we can use tools like discovery-swarm to create ad-hoc overlay networks for peering, but it's not finished yet.\r\n\r\nI like where you're head's at though, this is a move in the right direction.",
