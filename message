I can't pay my rent in beer, and I'd probably struggle to go through even a six pack every month (gotta get those numbers up), but it'd be kind of a fun thing to look forward to.\r\n\r\nReminds me of this link that I saw recently: https://producingoss.com/en/funding-non-programming.html\r\n\r\n> Even when you don't have people traveling to a meetup, you can still sponsor some of the meetup's expenses. Everyone remembers fondly the company that sponsors the pizza, or lunch, or drinks or dinner for one night of the meetup.\r\n\r\nIt's weird how valuable the personal touch is. I'd way rather have someone give me a fun $5 beer than give me $10 cash. That doesn't scale, but it's interesting to consider how much value we get from relationships with people we like.\r\n\r\n-- Sent from my [Ninkasi Galaxy Trippin' Stellar IPA](https://ninkasibrewing.com/our-beers/galaxy-trippin-stellar-ipa/)",
