I think I was mostly talking about the non-browser-compatible stuff, like the HTTP server, but reading through the rest of that page it makes lots of sense to me.\r\n\r\n> - Deno does not use npm\r\n>   - It uses modules referenced as URLs or file paths\r\n\r\nTo be honest, this is pretty killer. I've been wondering **why do we even publish on npm**, and after googling around for a few days I literally can't find a single answer. I think I started publishing my modules on npm because that's what was expected by everyone else, but I think that just benefits npm as a company.\r\n\r\nWhy not just:\r\n\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnpm install https://example.com/package.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nEspecially after the kik + left-pad fiasco, it seems like publishing on npm is *at best* a waste of time.",
