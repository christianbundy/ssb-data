That came out of [this discussion](https://github.com/fraction/oasis/issues/178), I'm feeling some want for a separation between \"we need this to support Patchwork users\" and \"this would be a cool futuristic feature\", since I really only have energy for the former right now, and I'm feeling the issues start to pile up.\r\n\r\nIf we had some notion of levels/milestones I could totally see the utility of organizing them with GitHub milestones, that could be really cool. I'd be down to experiment with this. +1",
