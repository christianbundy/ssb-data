If you feel like playing with simulations, I love [Going Critical](https://www.meltingasphalt.com/interactive/going-critical/) and the 'Immunity' slider is helpful for getting a visual intuition around this.\r\n\r\nWorst-case scenario for me is crappy, but probably survivable. Worst-case scenario for *us* is a small percentage of our gigantic population needing healthcare at the exact same time and exhausting the capabilities of our healthcare services.\r\n\r\nUS note: I've heard a few times that getting tested in the US costs about $3,000, which I can't imagine most people will have. I put off going to the doctor for the flu when it was $300, and I'm concerned that the financial cost of healthcare in the US is going to make this much harder for everyone.\r\n\r\n\\* I just want to point out that I didn't get my vaccine, which is how I was able to contract influenza this year. I will fix that in the future. :)",
