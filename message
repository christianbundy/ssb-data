As far as I can tell it looks like a well-specified and well-documented JSON message format, which gives us schemas for all types of messages:\n\n- activities\n- article\n- audio\n- relationship\n- document\n- event\n- group\n- image\n- note (like a post)\n- organization\n- page\n- person\n- profile\n- question\n- tombstone (!)\n- video\n\n...and a few more that I haven't looked into. As we're working on new features (e.g. tombstone feeds), I wonder whether it'd make sense to pay attention to the ActivityStreams spec and follow along where it's easy. I found an [old thread about this](%eI1IGY0T+BEGfG2KOt3x4yohQWEXXMBLtimJ/MC487U=.sha256) but I didn't find any clear answers there.\n\n**Anyone else have feelings about this?**\n\n#activitystreams #scuttlebutt",
