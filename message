I think I talked with [@Trav](@Gs0Rz7yEabDd1GyrnjZ1acPrcHL+rx8irnLl4ys/sU4=.ed25519) a bit about *A Pattern Language* but I hadn't spent any time looking into collective intelligence or systems change, looks like I've got some reading to do!\n\nI'd love to follow [@csageland](@ZYYIdnc55PRWr4Ztzjewbd64mfUWQTyw2wy6zPwcK3k=.ed25519)'s suggestion and have a call on this. I'm not sure I'll have any solid solutions to share, but I'd really like to have a higher-bandwidth conversation about this.\n\n> Terrible theory of change: earthâ€™s immune system will kick-in and will cure itself from cancerous human cultures.\n\nThis is my concern. I'm surrounded by people who care deploy about solving important problems but the discussions about solutions are so abstract that I don't know how to apply them. I suppose I'm looking for some roadmap of *direct actions* that we can take, hopefully building some feedback loops that pave the way for future movements and improvements.",
