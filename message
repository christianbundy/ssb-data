    "text": "Just one more thought: another problem we're going to have is that you can have views loaded in one client but not another, so while *appends* are added whenever the view is loaded that isn't true for the rest of the API.\n\nFor example, if you start Patchbay and do a `flumedb.append()` followed by `flumedb.rebuild()` then all of the active views will append and then self-destruct. If you switch to Patchwork and it has different views, then they'll see the append but *not* the rebuild, because from the perspective of flumedb that rebuild has already been completed.\n\nI suppose my concerns are that:\n\n1. We're attempting full rebuilds on level views that support `del()` natively.\n2. Some/many views don't support rebuilds in the first place.\n3. Rebuilds are not respected by inactive views."
