Usually when people start to understand the costs of repairing society after a collapse they become interested in preventing the collapse from occurring in the first place.\n\nI skimmed the video but didn't hear anything, and I couldn't find any relevant links in the YouTube description. I could've sworn that there was a website dedicated to it, maybe with a name like:\n\n- Mitigating climate crisis\n- Surviving climate collapse\n- Repairing after climate collapse\n- ???\n\nAny chance that resource (or methodology) is familiar to one of you?\n\n   ",
