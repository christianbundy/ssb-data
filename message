It's the exact same as how conventional pubs work, except that you don't follow the pub.\n\nThe pub still follows you and hosts your data, but it doesn't pollute your social/trust graph with other randos who have redeemed invites with the pub. The idea is that the pub is added to `gossip.json` and is used to sync feeds, but since you don't follow the pub it shouldn't change your social/trust graph at all.\n\nAs long as you have someone else on the network to follow, this should work great! For folks who know *nobody* on the network, this is sub-optimal because the one-way pub doesn't introduce them to anyone new.\n\nI'd love to chat about this sometime, but I think the easy/hacky way would be to switch steps 4 and 5 in [this post](%B6VJPEN4X/8uh9rORgjSquZbrTgqhcSsRCArsOim9Qk=.sha256), so you'd:\n\n1. use pub invite\n2. unfollow pub\n3. wait for download to finish\n\nMaybe that'd remove the server restart constraint? You could keep hops as-is and then just load plugins without a restart, or at least that's how I *think* it'd work.",
