I'm stretched very thin between the source code, the npm package, the Arch Linux packages (stable and `-git`), and the AppImage, and I don't even have a way to test the deb/exe/dmg/brew/snap packages.\r\n\r\nI'm doing my best to take care of all of the things I can reliably test, but the rest are provided on a best-effort basis -- hopefully maintained by the people who use them.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, my feel is (and has been) that Patchwork is a Great Client For Right Now but since nobody really wants to continue developing Patchwork I'm just keeping it on life support until one of the next-gen SSB clients is ready for general usage from beginners.
