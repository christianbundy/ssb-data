I'd like to see artists paid for their work, but if possible it would be really cool to avoid copyright and \"ownership\" over information that costs nothing to copy and share. I understand that creating software and creating art are likely very different, but my hope is that there's enough money in commissions, live shows, subscriber-only content, etc., that we don't need to chain ourselves to the copyright system.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I'm not trying to pay my groceries by selling art, so please feel free experiment with any and all funding systems that decrease the amount of suck in the world.",
