    "text": "Update: Bought 16 feet of 2x2 from a reclaimed lumber yard near my workspace.\r\n\r\nNow I need:\r\n\r\n- **Fasteners:** I'm tempted to use wooden dowel pins but I feel like I should just find the actual bolts that I need. I think I need a bunch of 3/8 inch bolts that are *just* over 3 inches long (~90mm), plus nuts and washers.\r\n- **Saw**: I have a backpacking saw but that feels bad. I'll probably need to use a hand saw because of where I'm working.\r\n- Depending on the fastener used, maybe a bit or socket to hook up to my drill.\r\n\r\nI don't have a template to use so I think my first project should probably be a jig for drilling holes with a hand drill. Maybe there are already designs for this? Also, I'm way more bothered than I should be about the imperial versus metric thing. 1.5 inches is *very close* to 4 cm, but it's not the same. In an effort to avoid analysis paralysis I think I'll just go with the 1.5 inches, because it's smaller, but I'm not sure that this is the right thing to do.",
