I was curious about memory usage and realized that lots of people upload gigantic high-resolution blobs as profile images, which is *great* until you're showing 100 of them in a tab and IIRC they get duplicated in memory.\r\n\r\nSharp just does a super-quick resize ([example](https://oasis-demo.fraction.io/image/64/%26jqp3ImUpZZ4QD%2FAcST54J24aGaB3lJg5IDG82TeBmN4%3D.sha256)) for thumbnail images so that browsers don't have to hold the full-size image in memory. It's 100% optional and if you don't have it then Oasis just has the same behavior as all of the existing clients: the browser is responsible for the resize.",
