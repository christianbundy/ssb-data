This should do the trick:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nps ax | grep '[o]asis'  | awk '{ print $1 }' | xargs kill\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough *really*, it sounds like you have two problems, both of which would make for great GitHub issues if you'd like to document them:\r\n\r\n- Not being able to close Oasis -- known issue, although not documented anywhere. :)\r\n- 'I can't seem to edit my profile through Oasis' sounds like a bug I haven't heard. My profile has an 'Edit profile' link, maybe you're on an old version? `npx global-install fraction/oasis` should bring you up-to-date.",
