Police are violence workers who protect the state and capital, and questioning their role in society is literally the opposite of fascism. \r\n\r\nSure, calling names isn't polite, and 'bastard' is an outdated insult, and \"all cops are bad\" might be more friendly as \"cops aren't the best solution to public safety\", but I think we should focus our criticism on the violent authoritarians instead of how the victims are expressing their grief and outrage.\r\n\r\nIdea: If you don't like ACAB/FTP, maybe you could suggest (and use!) an alternative with a similar sentiment? I know you're coming from a good place, but \"I don't like how you express your feelings about murder\" feels kinda bad.\r\n\r\nAnyway, looking forward to discussing with you. Text is hard, so I'm hoping this came across how I'd like. ‚ù§",
