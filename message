Especially if you're talking about Node.js, [you're in good company.](https://github.com/nodejs/roadmap/issues/1)\r\n\r\n> the Promises VS Async problem\r\n\r\nCould this possibly be 'promises vs callbacks'? My feel is that promises add a layer of predictability to callbacks, at the cost of some performance. The real power is here:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// callback style\r\ndb.get(42, (err, person) => {\r\n  db.getOneFriend(person, (err, friend) => {\r\n    db.getOneParent(friend, (err, parent) => {\r\n      console.log(parent) // parent of friend\r\n    })\r\n  })\r\n})\r\n\r\n// promise style\r\ndb.get(42)\r\n  .then(db.getOneFriend)\r\n  .then(db.getOneParent)\r\n  .then(console.log)\r\n```\r\n\r\n> async development turns debug code a nightmare, as there’s nothing ensure that A will run before B\r\n\r\nTrue! Async software is really hard, but it can also be really fast. You can use `await` if you'd like some predictability at the cost of speed.\r\n\r\n> Locking problem\r\n\r\nIf you bump into this with any small pieces of software you've written, feel free to ping me! I know that JS has a bad reputation, but it shouldn't be freezing or locking or anything silly. 🤔\r\n\r\n>  Maybe I’m the stupid one that can’t see how magical is JS.\r\n\r\nNot at all! JS isn't a simple language, it's just a super common language. I think that over time lots of JS devs learn where the footguns are and we end up using a subset of the language, which isn't super visible if you don't know what to look for.",
