Cooking is great, we've been baking lots of bread lately and currently have a pizza in the oven with 5 minutes left. A few days ago we did some \"pepperoni\" with chickpeas, where I learned that 99.9% of pepperoni is just oil and seasoning (!), and tonight is the usual BBQ chickpea stuff.\r\n\r\nWhat's your hydroponic garden gonna look like? That's really exciting!",
