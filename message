If you notice that someone makes you feel weird or that your peers act differently around them, exercise caution. Note that this *could* backfire if you run in bigoted circles and the weird vibe is just bigotry, but I don't think that's the case.\n- **Favors:** Favors from friends are great, but unfriendly folks often use them for leverage and power. Sometimes that means they're trying to create a debt, other times it means that they've got weird motives. Maybe they want to guilt you into something, maybe they want to use you for social proof, or maybe they're actually just friendly. Favors aren't a red flag by themselves, but when combined with other manipulative signs you should probably be skeptical. If the favor is too good to be true, *it is*.\n- **Crunch:** Most things in life are not urgent. When someone insists on synchronous or AFK discussion it can sometimes be because they want to pressure you into a decision you wouldn't otherwise make. \"I'll have to think about it\" is a good phrase here, and has saved me when I'm not in a headspace to try to reject them.\n- **I can't:** Save \"I don't want to\" for friends who you trust and use \"I can't\" for everyone else. When someone says \"I don't want to\" manipulative people often take that for \"I need to be convinced\", which is rarely what you're trying to express.\n- **This time:** It's silly, but adding \"this time\" to rejections often makes it easier for me. \"Not this time\" and \"I can't today\" are less likely to be argued against and somehow have decreased the amount of manipulation attempts after the rejection.\n- **Why:** \"Why not? Do you have other plans? What can I do to make you say yes?\" Don't waste energy justifying your decisions to people trying to take advantage of you. \"I can't\" is still fine, and *if you must be polite* then \"sorry\" is fine too. Obviously use your judgement here, but generally when manipulative people ask questions like this it's because they're looking to find footholds to manipulate you.\n- **Boundaries:** These are the hardest, but working in software makes this a bit easier. If you have to deal with manipulative people you'll often need to set clear and hard boundaries. This is super dependent context, but might look like \"I'll meet you for lunch at noon but I have to be back to work by 2 PM, and I can't pay for your lunch today\".\n- **Don't give them power:** If you can avoid it, don't put yourself in situations where manipulative people are in power. Avoid events that they're hosting, carpools where they're driving, or any other situation where they're in a position of social authority.\n- **Just leave:** If you find yourself in a scenario that you don't like, you have every right to leave. The key here is that *don't have to be polite to people who are manipulating you*, and I'd argue that it's a Very Bad Thing. Leave the event, get out of the car (safely, please), or say \"I gotta go\" and go anywhere where they're not. It can feel bad, but you have to look out for yourself because they won't.\n\nI'm not sure how to say this best, but the above is assuming that you know you're being manipulated and are practicing self-defense. Like physical self-defense, most of these would be inappropriate if the person was just mildly obnoxious or something silly. I don't want to advocate for jumping out of a moving car because someone put country music on the radio, but it *may* be a valid option if they're aggressively trying to persuade you into sleeping at their place.\n\n```xml\n</rant>\n```",
