[This post](%CfOLR34kEPKIM8t3b3fFLHiaKHwKEIlHWdCQfqgVsOY=.sha256) might be relevant here, as it seems like we might (?) be switching to an NPM org rather than using the ssbc-owners repo. Not completely sure.\n\n> I'd would relive quite the burdon from me that others could at least publish patched versions if push comes to shove.\n\nI think I'm out of the loop, could you unpack this a bit? If there's already a post on it please link and I'll bring myself up-to-date.",
