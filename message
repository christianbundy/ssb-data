    "text": "# SSBC and its future\r\n\r\nI've been thinking about the SSBC a lot lately and I'd like to propose some changes. The SSBC has grown rapidly since [2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20150818105945/https://github.com/ssbc), and we've collected tons of code under the 'SSBC' banner, but I've noticed that decision-making within the \"organization\" is [structureless](https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm). We've watched thoughtful and intelligent people push for change, through the [Scuttlebutt Dialectic Framework](%ZfT6V+0eE9so1EIPxm8uQ852WFvio691JBAxs8QNqRQ=.sha256) and [SSB Specification Drafts](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-spec-drafts), and while we've experimented with various tools for governance I haven't seen anyone commit to any particular governance model.\r\n\r\n> The nice thing about standards is that you have so many to choose from.\r\n>\r\n> -- Andrew S. Tanenbaum\r\n\r\nThe SSBC is an amorphous playground of people and ideas that we've poured lots of energy into, but it's a textbook example of a tragedy of the commons that burns out our friends and colleagues. Instead of trying to radically reform the SSBC, I'd like to propose a mitosis:\r\n\r\n- **Secure Scuttlebutt Consortium** -- Playground of software, specifications, and research.\r\n- **SSB-JS** -- Healthy commons of dependable JavaScript applications and libraries.\r\n\r\nTo be explicit, I don't want to continue pouring energy into the SSBC. I'd like to move our core JS modules into a smaller organization with clearly defined boundaries, explicit expectations, and collective decision-making that takes care of our needs. I'm tired of working alone together -- I want to collaborate on software as a team, and I think this is a step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see something like the C4 process ([example](&DOzbd61NN0h3d3QTgokuXnA3KsJMxabGm4U2Yvqfx6c=.sha256)), but the things that I'd be really interested to see:\r\n\r\n- Projects have consistent internal style.\r\n- Projects have automated tests that pass.\r\n- Projects have multiple active maintainers.\r\n- List of maintainers is public and accessible.\r\n- Contributor workflow is public, accessible, and **easy**.\r\n- Maintainer workflow is public, accessbile, and **consistent**.\r\n- Contributors have a clear and equitable path to become maintainers.\r\n- Maintainers who are inactive or fail to follow rules should be removed.\r\n- We have systems for collective decision-making to make and change policies.\r\n\r\nStakeholders (you know who you are): Please communicate whether this is something you'd like to participate in (üëç) or something you'd be uncomfortable with (üëé).\r\n\r\nCC: [@mixmix](@ye+QM09iPcDJD6YvQYjoQc7sLF/IFhmNbEqgdzQo3lQ=.ed25519) [@arj](@6CAxOI3f+LUOVrbAl0IemqiS7ATpQvr9Mdw9LC4+Uv0=.ed25519) [@andrestaltz](@QlCTpvY7p9ty2yOFrv1WU1AE88aoQc4Y7wYal7PFc+w=.ed25519) [@Luandro](@2RNGJafZtMHzd76gyvqH6EJiK7kBnXeak5mBWzoO/iU=.ed25519) [@SoapDog (SPX)](@0xkjAty6RSr5uhbAvi0rbVR2g9Bz+89qiKth48ECQBE=.ed25519) [@cel-desktop](@lOUVT+Phkvai9a/cCS/RKo+S9hnPAQdVixms/7ldpPA=.ed25519)\r\n\r\n#ssbc #ssb-js #governance #maintainers",
