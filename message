I'll re-add Travis back to SSBC.\r\n\r\n(hermes-bot is meant to have minimal permissions because we have to share a personal access token with Travis -- it doesn't have full SSBC permissions because that's very scary. It was originally called patchwork-bot but I thought it might be useful for Patchbay as well. It'd probably be safer to have one bot per repo but convenience and security are usually opposites.)",
