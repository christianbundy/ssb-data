Could you clarify your point a bit here? My understanding is that Thunberg has made specific recommendations ([examples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Thunberg#Thunberg's_message)), like you suggested, which I don't see as \"getting children even more anxious\".\r\n\r\nMaybe useful context: I'm very supportive of bottom-up transformations and have avoided animal products for years, but I'm not keen on hostility toward young lefty activists who are (if nothing else) trying their hardest to exercise political power over their future. Let's build something in parallel instead of tearing friendly people down. âœ¨",
