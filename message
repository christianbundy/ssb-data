    "text": "# Is this cyberspace?\n\n> [**Cyberspace**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace) is widespread, interconnected digital technology.\n\nMost of my time in the digital world has been spent in cyberspace, but when thinking about distributed technologies I'm not sure that it really follows the conventional shared definition of \"cyberspace\". For example, when I'm browsing Patchwork it sure *feels* like cyberspace, but when I'm offline it really *isn't* widespread or interconnected. Is there a word for this?\n\nFor example, I've been trying to self-host more software and I've been building up what feels like an instance of cyberspace, but that sounds like a contradiction in terms. Intracyberspace? There has to be a better name for this.\n\ncc: [@dan](@NeB4q4Hy9IiMxs5L08oevEhivxW+/aDu/s/0SkNayi0=.ed25519) potentially an aside, but I've noticed that you use the term \"cypherspace\" -- have you defined that anywhere?",
