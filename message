Although admittedly I'm very concerned about the accessibility of text-only interfaces (especially those from the  scene subculture). I think they can be intimidating for most people (\"why doesn't my mouse work\") and I can't imagine how a screen reader tries to vocalize ASCII tables and such. ðŸ˜±\r\n\r\nFor years now I've been desperate for some kind of declarative UI framework where you describe the interface and it spits out CLI, TUI, GUI, and web interfaces, but it seems like you'd get a bunch of sub-par interfaces.",
