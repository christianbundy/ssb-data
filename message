I'm overusing async/await in a few places where it's probably degrading performance, but I'm trying to focus on making it work (correctly!) before trying to make it fast. I was able to implement some simple threading, a raw JSON view, like counts, and like/unlike functionality, which all went faster than expected.\n\n![Screenshot of André's post in Oasis, showing a red/pink heart button highlighted to denote that I liked his post.](&iahE+keeF+tMMmzq33/4NGvZMx7fL3x//pdGCv/T6Q0=.sha256)\n\nI'd love to experiment with AsyncIterables but I couldn't find much info on their compatibility. I found [`for await...of`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of) on MDN but couldn't determine what it's called on https://node.green/. Any chance you know?",
