Do you have an idea of when your proposed implementation might be ready to check out?\r\n\r\nI'm excited at the idea of building access control lists on top of a logical clock, and I think it's an elegant solution to the same-as problem, but I'm noticing that I don't have a feel for whether you're thinking that we should wait a week, month, year, etc., before having another option to consider.\r\n\r\n(We can totally talk about this privately, but I wanted to publish this here just to keep the conversation moving and try to avoid letting myself drop the ball. ‚ù§)",
