On the other hand, I'd *love* to run something like `src --remote github:ssbc` to only return projects where the ssbc org was configured as a remote. Is that your use-case?\n\n[@cryptix](@p13zSAiOpguI9nsawkGijsnMfWmFd5rlUNpzekEE+vI=.ed25519) \n\nI've meant to try Fish for a long time, but I'm hesitant to lose the Bash compatibility of Zsh. Has that been an issue for you? I don't often have problems moving around, but since I don't globally install *most* NPM packages I don't have executables like `patchbay` in my global path. I could `alias patchbay=(cd ~/src/patchbay && electron index.js`, but somehow `src patchbay --start` just feels better. Eventually I'd like this to extend to non-NPM packages so I don't need to memorize the correct new syntax for every utility.\n\nI miss dmenu! I think eventually I'll jump ship from GNOME Shell (again), but it feels nice to be running the (IMO) de facto standard desktop environment, although of course I have my nitpicks like everyone else.",
