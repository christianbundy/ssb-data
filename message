Off the top of my head:\n\n- pull-streams\n- hyperscript\n- mutant\n- mcss\n- depject\n\nAnything I'm missing? I'm learning a ton, but I think this is one of the first Node projects I couldn't pick up and start hacking on without learning all new infrastructure. Here's an example from one of the tabs I have open: https://github.com/ssbc/patchcore/blob/master/about/html/link.js\n\nAnyone else have (or *having*) a similar experience?"
