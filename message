I'd totally cover the costs on something like that.\r\n\r\nI'm using 2Ã—2 dimensional lumber which is *supposed to* be 1.5 inches (~38.1 mm), but I've been using reclaimed lumber from deconstructed buildings ([now required by law in Portland for demolishing buildings built after 1916](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bps/70643)), so the dimensions are all over the place.\r\n\r\n(Maybe I should have a hand plane and only buy wood that's >= to the dimensions I want?)\r\n\r\nHere's all the measurements I have, I think some are irrelevant but I'd rather include too much info that not enough info\r\n\r\n- **Wood:** 1.5\" by 1.5\"\r\n- **Holes:** 5/16\" diameter every 1.5\"\r\n- **Bolts:** 1/4\"-20 by 3.5\", 7/16\" hex head\r\n- **Washers:** 1/4\"\r\n- **Nuts:** 1/4\"-20 by ???, 7/16\" hex head",
