I didn't consider implementing the database with pure buffers, I bet that eliminates all sorts of the memory consumption problems (and adds lots of implementation flexibility). Do you have thoughts on how that might be serialized to a database most effectively?\r\n\r\nI've been playing around with SQLite more because it's super boring, but it's Boring As A Feature which is nice. Now that you have a database I wonder how difficult it'd be to implement a small SSB interface...\r\n\r\n(Btw, if this is something you'd like more feedback on I'd totally recommend making a new thread about it -- comments are easy for other people to miss, I only saw this because you @mentioned me!)",
