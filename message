    "text": "Just wrote a small alternative to flumeviews that I'm feeling quite good about: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/christianbundy/oasis/blob/slow-start/better.js\r\n\r\nIt's tiny, it stores all indexes in memory (!), and it's very fast (> 1 million messages per minute on my laptop). The big pro/con is that it doesn't persist indexes anywhere, so we avoid the pain points of backward compatibility and shared indexes (#against-consensus). The current indexes, which are **not optimized** but still fast enough:\r\n\r\n- Messages by type\r\n- Messages by author\r\n- Latest `seq` by author\r\n- Roots referenced by author (!!! very helpful for notifications !!!)\r\n- About messages by author\r\n  - Name\r\n  - Image\r\n  - Description\r\n- Notifications for author (mentions + new messages from thread author has posted in)\r\n- Full text search (lookups on all words with 3+ characters)\r\n\r\n**I cannot stress how easy this is**. I wrote like ~100 lines of actual code and I don't have to worry about plugins or flumeviews or compatibility with the JavaScript stack. Maybe this would make it simpler for Oasis/etc to run on Rust/Go/etc?\r\n\r\n#ssb #ssb-dev #databases #flumedb",
