My gut reaction is to be less excited about SQLite, but I'm going to stew on this for a while before accepting any conclusions. (The tension is basically between \"lots of contributors are good\" and \"SQLite is good\", and I'm unsure whether this is an exception or whether my heuristics are un-good.)\r\n\r\nI'm happy to see you're experimenting in that direction, please CC me if you have any licensing eureka moments in the future -- this stuff is really interesting to me and it's one of my few philosophical interests that isn't limited to navel-gazing. :~)",
