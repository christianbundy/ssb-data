    "text": "Related: today I hooked up a Raspberry Pi (3B+) to my speakers with an aux cord and installed [bt-speaker](https://github.com/lukasjapan/bt-speaker) and it works well enough. I think it'd be simple to add another [wired] speaker, and in the future maybe even a wireless speaker. This means that I'd be able to use a common protocol like Bluetooth between my handheld or laptop computer and then some less-common-but-more-better protocol to sync the audio between a few small computers.\n\nFrom what I've read, the Raspberry Pi is both sub-par *and* overkill for something as simple as streaming audio over bluetooth, but that's what you get with non-specialized hardware that's Good Enough for lots of use-cases.",
