The result is a tiny web app that runs locally and lets you compose messages with immediate feedback from ssb-markdown.\n\nIt's super simple *and* it works -- I'm using it right now!\n\n- Type text into a simple `<textarea>`.\n- Immediately see the results in a live-updating preview pane.\n- Click \"publish\" and your text will be posted to Scuttlebutt.\n\nI think I've been spending time trying to unravel implementation hairballs and it's *super refreshing* to write something small from scratch. Sure, it lacks all sorts of features (images, autocomplete, the `mentions` property, auto-save, and others), but it felt good to build and I wanted to share. I'll post a screenshot from a normal client and push up the source once it's a bit less broken.\n\nI'm about to hit \"publish\", wish me luck!\n\nðŸ™ƒ"
