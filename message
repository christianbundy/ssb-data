    "text": "Yeah, I talked a bit about how I've been feeling inspired by cooperatives and wanting to do something similar here in the US, but haven't really been reaching out about it because I don't feel that I already have the answers. The paradoxical bit is that reaching out is something you do when you need help, but somehow I've been avoiding it. I should probably do a more fleshed-out post on what I'm looking for, as I'm sure there are a handful of us in the US (and the PNW, cc: [@ike](@+aQL1YGSyeEIhPRMcw96/ztOy41RoKSGD7la7BUZVmA=.ed25519)) who are looking for tech co-ops.\n\nMix mentioned income sharing, which really intrigues me, but I think that's something I should really research a bit deeper before declaring my never-ending love for ir. With that said, I've always enjoyed sharing financial ups and downs with friends, and it's only burned me a few times.\n\nThe monthly meetup was a cool idea too, where you might have some friendly butts with similar work (maybe?) who you can talk to about your projects and share ideas and solidarity even if you're not sharing income.",
