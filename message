    "text": "I've been trying to be a bit more frutal lately, and after cutting off my membership at the local indoor rock gym I've been looking to start exercising again. When I was at the gym I'd cycle between climbing, lifting weights, and cardio, but I'm having trouble trying to figure out how I can lift weights without a gym membership or a large living space.\n\nIt seems a bit weird, but I've been wondering whether it's legal to just haul some weights to a nearby park and lift on a flat area, or whether that's more trouble that it's worth. Hell, I could see the potential to share a set of weights within my neighborhood and just go set them up with a rack once per day at a given time, but I'm sure there are legal reasons why that's a bad idea.\n\nAnyone in a similar setup with thoughts on how to exercise without a gym membership or a living space big enough to exercise in? I'm hoping the answer isn't bodyweight fitness, but I could definitely be convinced.",
