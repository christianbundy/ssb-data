Also, I might recommend [SSB-CLI](https://github.com/fraction/ssb-cli) if you haven't already messed around with it.  I'm tempted to make SSB-CLI just depend on my PR branch since I've been using it for a month without issues, but that always feels so janky.\r\n\r\nYou should also probably be aware of [this bug](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-invite/pull/10#issuecomment-561939051), if you ever bump into the \"use is not in list of accepted methods\" error.",
