I'd love to see someone else take on this work, but if there isn't any interest I could probably help with this.\n\nRegarding requirements, building non-Electron and non-npm installers might be its own little subproject. I've sunk a decent amount of time into [solving this problem](%MzQCXqyPXXyTr84/+utU4UXkWCsufpT48lcEgV89wYM=.sha256) and can't find many good solutions. \n\n> e.g. Vue.js (this would be my current strong preference)\n\nAny thoughts on just using HTTP and static HTML? ðŸ™ƒ",
