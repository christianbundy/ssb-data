I can see the problem with my batch file -- the Node.js binary is in `node.exe` instead of `/bin/node` on macOS and Linux.\r\n\r\n> It took it 10 minutes to extract the files. Still, there are 13.596 files in that zip, thats quite a lot. ðŸ˜º\r\n\r\nOh no, ten minutes is really bad. Are there other archive formats that Windows has better support for? I chose `.zip` because it seems *fine* for all of the platforms, but maybe there's a better alternative? I could go back to my one-zip-per-platform distribution to make it a bit smaller, but since most of the `node_modules` are shared between them it feels silly.\r\n\r\n> There was no error, nothing, the thing just closed while I was using Patchfox at the same time. Very strange.\r\n\r\nThat *is* very strange, I wouldn't expect that at all. I recently compiled [new binaries](https://send.firefox.com/download/d48632da162c54df/#au0CZafnP_Nu1ExWu_VPpw) that avoid the batch file by instead using a small Go program to run Node -- do you think that would help?",
