I'm really inspired by Shellogram, and all of the work you've done really highlighted the fact that we need interfaces that are easier to improve over time.\r\n\r\nTangent: Any chance you have opinions on what the default theme should be? I've been trying to find a light theme that feels familiar for people who use the modern web, but the modern web often gives a sterile vibe that I'd like to avoid.\r\n\r\nThe themes I've been considering lately:\r\n\r\n- atelier-forest-light\r\n- atelier-sulphurpool-light\r\n- default-light\r\n- google-light\r\n- harmonic16-light\r\n- horizon-light\r\n- material\r\n- one-light\r\n- solarized-light\r\n- tomorrow\r\n\r\nNo worries if you don't have the time/energy/interest, but I want to ask for your feedback either way.
