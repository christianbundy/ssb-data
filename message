I can probably swing a portable AC, but they're like $500 and aren't as effective as window air conditioners.\n\nI've seen ice + fan conditioners, but I'm not sure whether that's #sustainable or whether it'll just burn a ton of electricity trying to freeze ice every night. \n\nAny ideas?\n\ncc: #offgrid #solarpunk  #opensource #electronics #freesoftware",
