I just found a supposed \"admit one\" ticket for a conference in Portland, with \"crimethinc\" written on the back. I looked up [the website] (https://www.cchr.org/) and it doesn't look very low-budget like most conspiracy-type sites. I don't really think of CrimethInc being very anti-psychiatry, is that a thing? I suppose the whole \"you are CrimethInc\" thing might make that pretty subjective."
