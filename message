Most of us literally can't even build from the actual Git source, not even considering how boned we'd be if our relationship with GitHub became degraded (technically or politically). **We're building an awesome P2P future, and I'd argue that npm and GitHub aren't necessary to get us there.**\r\n\r\nMy one quick point: both npm and GitHub are still Where The People Are, and I think they make for fine *mirrors*, but I'd be very hesitant to continue using them as a source of truth for our activities and artifacts.",
