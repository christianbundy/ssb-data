SSB doesn't let you skip any posts, so if you have the most recent post(s) then you should have all the old ones too.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note: Oasis just shows 64 messages in each view and doesn't (yet) do any pagination. If you're only seeing 64 posts on your profile page, that's expected, but you shouldn't be \"missing some previous self-identification and follow posts\". Could you add more details about that problem?",
