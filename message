There *are* distributions of open source software that are available on walled garden app stores, but often developers build something because [they want to use it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) rather than that they want others to use it.\n\nUnfortunately I think the problem is two-fold: developers often become insulated in communities of other developers, and users just uninstall the app because they don't feel empowered to resolve the issues they see. Even [bug reports](%lT+mBsH9pD82FSj9hligwsLHlqRGbzpOQ9pXm+qwzKI=.sha256) suck for non-developers (and developers too, if we're being honest). \n\nAnyway, I think many/most/all of us would love to hear specific pain points you have with SSB. Thanks for this post! ",
