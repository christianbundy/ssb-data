    "text": "This morning I was rudely awakened by the fire alarm going off in the bedroom around 06:00. The fire alarm was going off in the rest of the apartment building as well, which happens every few years when somebody burns toast really badly, but once the building fire alarm is triggered it doesn't turn off until the fire department comes by. Fun!\r\n\r\nThe cats were very unhappy with the sound, and they *really* didn't like being put into their cat carriers, but traversing after **the loudest staircase in the world** we got to hang outside for a bit until the fire department came through.\r\n\r\nWhen we got back inside I saw an email from the property management company:\r\n\r\n> We were notified by our alarm monitoring company that they received a \"lobby pull signal\", meaning someone pulled the building fire alarm in the lobby.\r\n\r\n> We have a tech in route to assess the situation. If you feel more comfortable exiting the building until we have determined what is going on, you are welcome to do that. \r\n\r\n> We will update you once we have more information. \r\n\r\nThis was sent at 06:44, *after* the fire department had turned off the alarm, and set off my ~~spidey~~ software senses that this was a technology problem. A few minutes later I received this:\r\n\r\n> We have had a maintenance tech assess the situation. He has determined that it was a false alarm and there is no need to worry. \r\nWe will work to determine what happened in this situation. \r\n\r\n> We are sorry for the inconvenience this caused. \r\n\r\n!!!\r\n\r\nSounds like some buggy technology? This building has had problems before, like having the fire alarm randomly go off for ~1 second and then stop, and I'm frustrated/anxious that the loudspeakers in my bedroom and living room are hooked up to such buggy tech.\r\n\r\n/rant",
