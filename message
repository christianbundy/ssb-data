In the past I've used Trello and liked it, but I've been trying to slowly part from centralized and proprietary software-as-a-service tools. I found a list of [self-hosted task management tools](https://github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted#task-managementto-do-lists) but I haven't heard of most of them. Can anyone recommend a tool that they like to use? Bonus points if it's easy for others to use and collaborate without any domain-specific knowledge (i.e. not org-mode ðŸ˜‰).\n\nThanks!"
