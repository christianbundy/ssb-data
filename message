I just pushed a fix for a similar problem, but if you're still seeing that problem could you maybe start it from a terminal and look for console output? Sorry to have such a buggy experience!\r\n\r\n> I also tried running Oasis as node app, but it crashes at `setImmediate` in `src/http.js`, because server is still `null`.\r\n\r\nOh, I didn't realize that it could take more than 1 tick to start the server. I can loop `setTimeout()` or something maybe?\r\n\r\n> but there are further problems\r\n\r\nIf you post these I'd be happy to dig into them, thanks for the info! For what it's worth, I'm on Linux and my partner has a macOS device that Oasis-Desktop is running on, but I haven't seen it work on Windows. The Oasis CI service (Travis CI) says that it's passing tests on Windows, but I haven't seen this or been able to test Oasis-Desktop on Windows at all.",
