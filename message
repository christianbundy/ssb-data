I don't think it manages identities, but the goal was / is to get it running in the system tray (assuming your OS has one).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I'd be super open to doing this sort of thing in #oasis. If we went that direction it'd need to run in a web browser, but I don't [personally] think that's a bad thing.\r\n\r\nI think there are two major problems we'll run into:\r\n\r\n- If we go the ssb-identities route then it only works with software that's programmed to understand and use ssb-identities.\r\n- If we go deeper then we can switch out files and restart the server so that client software doesn't have to know about ssb-identities, but I think we'll have problems with unboxers and transforms since one identity might receive messages encrypted for another identity. There's a long post about this somewhere, but my search functionality isn't working very well. :~)",
