Is this the case, or are we just trusting our friends not to sue us for copyright infringement? I remember some discussion between [@andré](@QlCTpvY7p9ty2yOFrv1WU1AE88aoQc4Y7wYal7PFc+w=.ed25519) and [@elavoie](@IgYpd+tCtXnlE2tYX/8rR2AGt+P8svC98WH3MdYAa8Y=.ed25519) a while ago but I don't remember think there was a conclusion.\r\n\r\nWould it be wise to avoid replicating content we don't have an explicit copyright for? Or has this problem already been solved through some hand-wavey legal magic?\r\n\r\n#copyright #copyleft #ssb",
