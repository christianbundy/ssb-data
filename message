Maybe 'safety' or whatever makes the most sense to you? I think I'm a bit hesitant to deeply integrate with GitHub or start using lots of their different project management features -- I've seen lots of repos turn into project management salad with labels + milestones + projects + actions + wikis + etc and I'm already feeling over-stimulated as is. ðŸ˜¬",
