I honestly don't remember the last time I had churros. I used to have some raspberry-filled ones in high school that I think kind of ruined churros for me. Did you ever have weird school foods that you got once every week that were just sort of weird? We got these [galaxy pizzas](https://www.schwansfoodservice.com/product/?page=tony_s_galaxy_pizza_4_round_galaxy_pepperoni_pizza-78365) literally 24/7 and I remember kids used to go through like 20 napkins just soaking up the oil that pooled on top of them.",
