Similar to Patchfoo, it uses plain old HTML and CSS in the browser, serving pages over HTTP to a regular old web browser.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping that the code is accessible to beginner programmers and people who are new to JavaScript, but that's much easier said than done. I've already made some hacky duct-tape solutions that I'm super not proud of, but I'm hoping that once I finish the basic features (onboarding, following, better private messages, [etc](https://github.com/fraction/oasis/blob/master/docs/roadmap.md)) it'll be ready for full-time use.",
