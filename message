I took a few minutes to write a small SSB implementation, but it took some hackery and the signatures aren't valid. Not sure why, but I don't have time to investigate further today.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/christianbundy/example-ssb/tree/deno\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- Deno is fun! I like how it feels.\r\n- Base64 isn't in the standard library\r\n- SHA512 isn't in the standard library\r\n- Ed25519 isn't in the standard library and the third-party modules [doesn't work](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-ed25519/issues/7).\r\n- Decoding hexadecmial *was* in the standard library, but I couldn't find documentation so I had to read the source code to figure out the API.",
