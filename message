My biggest concern with Markdown/HTML character counts is that you might have either:\r\n\r\n- `hey all, [this is my website](http://exampl`\r\n- `hey all, <a href=\"https://example.example.c`\r\n\r\nI'm sure someone else has solved the \"take some HTML and try to cut it down to X characters\", if you're familiar with any methods I'd love to leran more about them. \r\n\r\n> (I see that Oasis encourages the ‚Äúmentions in the first paragraph‚Äù format by default ;))\r\n\r\nYeah, still not sure whether that's a good idea. üôÉ",
