I really only want to receive voice / SMS / MMS if:\r\n\r\n- the person calling me is in my contact list\r\n- the person calling me has a [secret] extension code\r\n  - when giving out my phone number I want to create one extension code per person so I know if they sell or share my phone number with others\r\n  - these extensions should be long enough that they're hard to guess but intrusion prevention like fail2ban might be overkill\r\n\r\nAnyone else who calls should be promptly redirected to [Lenny](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLduL71_GKzHHk4hLga0nOGWrXlhl-i_3g) for a maximum waste of time.\r\n\r\nAnyway, would love thoughts / experiences / recommendations if you have them. ðŸš€",
