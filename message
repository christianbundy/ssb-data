I wonder whether at some point it would make sense to just note the head of each feed rather than trying to wrangle tangles. That'd give us topological sorting of **all messages**, too, so we wouldn't have to topo-sort each individual tangle.\r\n\r\nAnother question just popped into my head: are tangles going to go through some RFC / #sdf process, or are they already finalized and decided on?",
