I was just reading through your voting process and saw this part:\r\n\r\n> As soon as there is any ! vote, the current proposal is put on hold, and the counter-proposal in the ! vote should be listened to, and voted on like any other proposal. All proposals have the same voting process, so that it's possible to have a chain of !, and along this chain, the original proposal is refined until everyone is satisfied.\r\n\r\nTechnical question: what happens in a case like this?\r\n\r\n- **Proposal** -- The sky is blue.\r\n- **`!` Counter-proposal** -- The sky is red.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to just say 'no' to the counter-proposal, or would you have to counter-counter-propose that the sky is, in fact, blue? I know that in reality we're dealing with reasonable humans operating in good faith, but it tickled my brain and so here we are.",
