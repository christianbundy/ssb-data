I think he has some interesting points, and I enjoy listening to his talks, but it gave me some Jordan Peterson vibes that I'm not sure what to do with.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that most of the related videos in the sidebar were Jordan Peterson, \"culture war\" videos, and related content that you'd expect from the extremely-online-alt-right crowd.\r\n\r\nCould you confirm that my braindar is just throwing false positives?
