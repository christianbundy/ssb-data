Anyone have suggestions for an elegant solution to this problem?\n\nI know that #patchfoo has the same problem, and I think the rough algorithm is:\n\n1. Parse the message for `@${name}` where `${name}` is a string without whitespace\n2. Compare the string to profile names set by `{ type: 'about' }` messages\n3. Cross your fingers that there aren't any duplicate names across the network (?!?)\n4. Create a key-value pair in `msg.value.content.mentions` to express the relationship\n\nI've got a few questions:\n\n- Is this the best way to do it?\n- Are there ways to express names with whitespace? `<@>${name}</@>`? ðŸ¤£\n- What are the best ways to handle duplicate names?",
