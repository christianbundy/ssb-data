I think there are basically three components I'm looking for:\r\n\r\n- Static site generator\r\n- Content management system\r\n- Support from my peer network\r\n\r\nI was excited about GitBook because it had all three, so I'm looking to see what everyone else is using these days. There are *tons* of static site generators and a handful of CMS solutions, but I'd like to make sure that some of my friends are happy with some combination of the above so I can skip the *which tool is best* frenzy.",
