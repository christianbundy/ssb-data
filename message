I'm using Koa, similar to Express, and I'm dreaming of a way to make it work in the browser for people who only have a web browser (not Node.js or HTTP). I'm looking for a **small library that serves HTTP from Node.js or serves a JavaScript web app from the browser**, depending on the environment that it's run on.\r\n\r\nI used to think that [Choo](https://choo.io/) could do this, but I'm not sure anymore. I know that the big front-end frameworks (React, Vue, etc) can do server-side rendering, but it's important to me that my application layer only knows about HTTP. **Can anyone recommend a tool I should use?**",
