Just yesterday I was talking with a friend about ways that our local area could provide food/water/shelter/etc for ourselves, but that important things like medicine can be very hard to DIY. Don't even get me started on computers. ðŸ™ƒ\r\n\r\n> Other than tech and Left politics, Iâ€™m a big fan of: music, board games, video games, sci-fi, animation, beer, succulents, and being outside.\r\n\r\nYes to all of the above. Any fun music or sci-fi you've been into lately?",
