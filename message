    "text": "About a year ago I found an online tool that let you generate permission labels / stickers for equipment in hackerspaces. I think it gave you the option of adding an owner, whether training was required, \"do not hack\", etc., but I can't find it anymore. It was like [this template](https://wiki.pumpingstationone.org/Template:EquipmentPage) except you could just generate it with a web form. I think Labitrack does something similar, but it's tied into Postgres/etc.\n\nAnyone know which tool I'm thinking of? I'd love to print out some stickers for stuff I'm down to share at my coworking space\n\ncc: [@dangerousbeans](@TXKFQehlyoSn8UJAIVP/k2BjFINC591MlBC2e2d24mA=.ed25519)\n\n#hackerspaces  ",
