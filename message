My rule is that I'll *always* do the oldest move first, that way I don't end up playing a game with someone while someone else is waiting. If I'm feeling overwhelmed, it's likely more appropriate to get the hell off my computer than it is to play a move on someone else's game. I've been doing this for a week or so and it's been good, but I'll update you if/when/how that changes.",
