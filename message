    "text": "I've been thinking about this problem almost non-stop over the past few days, and I'm realizing that I hold a few opinions that might be make for an interesting synthesis:\n\n- Maintaining software is expensive.\n- The biggest costs are, in my experience:\n  - **Supporting:** Answering questions, troubleshooting problems, and helping people use your project\n  - **Guiding:** Accepting patches, writing code reviews, and helping people contribute to your project\n  - **Improving:** Writing patches, asking for peer review, and improving the project for users and contributors\n- Maybe we could charge people directly for the things that cost us the most time/money?\n\nLots of projects get more GitHub issues than they can handle and less funding than they need. Maybe we could fix that? There are lots of problems with the [wide open net](%k6z0o+likJa2dU7toAzUmObB0qiewkdsKbc20u/hMr8=.sha256), maybe we should be hosting important discussions and collaborative to-do lists somewhere else? I'm thinking something that looks like:\n\n- GitHub is literally just a Git mirror, no issues or wikis (...but maybe releases?)\n- discussions and bug tracker stuff goes on a dedicated forum (...Loomio? SSB? idk)\n- the forum is restricted to only project members, no randos or internet strangers\n  - it costs $6 to start a membership, and membership renews for $1 per month (e.g. first year is $18)\n  - members can participate in issues and pull request and everything they'd usually do on GitHub\n  - maybe we can improve life for both maintainers and users? I don't think GitHub is an ideal\n    - on the other hand, idk how much time we should invest in these experiments\n\n**Bottom line:** I'd love to continue giving away code for free without giving away support for free. I think GitHub's UI encourages people to help internet strangers for free, which is cool, but draining as hell and probably counter-~~revolutionary~~productive.",
