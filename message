The interface you're using really shapes the network you see, and I think there are lots of easy wins. One of the recurring topics that came up in my discussions with [@generativist](@7TWBRhI7LSeJb5ZEBkExkTrEmOmZVGA7X2PSzbU3hDQ=.ed25519) is that there really isn't One True Algorithm, and that empowering people means giving them the power to change the way they see data on their social networks. For me, the 'Popular' page has been fantastic in outsourcing curation to others, and when I'm feeling lazy I can just pop that open and see the most popular conversations on SSB.\r\n\r\nOne bigger problem I really want to solve is [how to build intuitive filtering](https://github.com/fraction/oasis/issues/57), but in the meantime I'm happy to just add a page to Oasis that only shows root posts. \"Topics\"? Two questions on ergonomics:\r\n\r\n- Should this show posts from everyone, or just people you're following?\r\n- Should this show sub-topics (\"forks\"), or just *actual* root posts?\r\n\r\nReally interested in experimenting with this.",
