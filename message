No, right now there isn't even a way to set your own name (https://github.com/fraction/oasis/issues/208) so setting nicknames for others isn't supported either.\r\n\r\nI'm also concerned that nicknames add lots of vectors for abuse, where anyone can put a rude name on your profile without consent, and so I'm not sure that the problems solved are worth the problems we get as a result.\r\n\r\nI'd be very happy to discuss this if it's something you feel strongly about though!",
