I'd love to volunteer some time to work on this, if that's helpful.\n- [How is Patchbay licensed?](https://github.com/ssbc/patchbay/issues/213) It looks like `package.json` says it's licensed under the GPL v3, but `README.md` specifies that it's licensed under the MIT. \n\n![hermes thank you](&Tf8ZIWfFMal0Hkj+C81dA9EGEUN7nNxWBu0Jpila4YE=.sha256)",
