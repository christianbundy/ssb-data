Jerome just eats anything you put in front of him and his weight is becoming unhealthy, whereas Sunshine's issue is that she's getting older and has a sensitive stomach. If we leave Jerome's food out then Sunshine will eat it, wait a few hours, and vomit on the floor. No good.\n\nI've actually just purchased two of [these](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B011K9929Y/) and after a week or so I think the cats are doing well with them. Jerome seems to always have some leftover food (previously unheard of) and Sunshine hasn't been getting sick, so I wonder whether the food was just too... easy? ðŸ¤· \n\n---\n\n[@Stian](@jL0ALPNOLX5CKMifzGFW+sQoWUx6fSLOW9O/yNomPU4=.ed25519) \n\nI'm so happy that I didn't start down the DIY route, I'm sure it would've ended up looking something like that. Cats are so incredibly smart, except the whole \"every time I eat X it makes me vomit but I'll never stop\" thing.",
