I want to make sure I'm aware of your boundaries in the future, could you help me understand your expectations around `publicWebHosting` and our expectation of privacy?\r\n\r\nIn case it's helpful, my model of SSB is that posts are meant to be shared with anyone who will download them. I think we should be mindful about what we download (e.g. #free-listening) but I've been assuming that our default stance is *please replicate my feed*.\r\n\r\nMy sense is that you're feeling more like *please replicate my feed to any SSB node or trusted friend, but no strangers*, is that right? I guess I'm looking for more information on how to interpret `publicWebHosting`, too.\r\n\r\nTo be explicit, I'm happy to respect `publicWebHosting`, but I'm not sure what the default should be. Do you feel strongly that we should assume `false` by default? Or just that we should respect it when it's `true`?",
