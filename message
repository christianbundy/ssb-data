I think that's fine, it's just that utp-native seems to use a variable that makepkg uses internally, but my understanding is that it's fine as long as that code isn't trying to reference the makepkg `$srcdir`. I *think* they're trying to say \"we're not exporting makepkg's `$srcdir` so if your package depends on it then you're gonna have a bad time\", but I haven't done much research.",
