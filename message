I have contracting work that requires the use of GitHub.\n2. You can't migrate stars to another provider.\n3. There are _so_ many eyeballs on GitHub.\n\nI'm kind of thinking:\n\n1. Archiving all of my old repos and moving them to GitLab (?).\n2. Cancelling my GitHub subscription for private repositories.\n3. Maybe keeping GitHub up-to-date as a read-only mirror? I'm not sure.\n\nWhat are you all planning to do now that Microsoft owns GitHub?",
