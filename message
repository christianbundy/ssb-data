It used to be the case that news feeds were curated by companies and that social media feeds are curated by users. This is no longer the case.\n\nIt used to be the case that you could subscribe to *people*, which meant that your feed, the infinite-scroll hellscape we all know and love, was curated by people you followed in the order it was posted. Unfortunately there's more profit to be had in company-curated feeds where you have only an illusion of control, where content is sorted \"optimally\" by a corporate entity with a fiduciary responsibility to optimize for the extraction of profit.\n\nEvery time it happens everyone gets a bit frustrated, but generally we move forward in days, weeks, or (rarely) months. I've seen the transition between user-controlled feeds and company-curated feeds happen repeatedly: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat might make interesting case studies. My hope is that we'll be able to help everyone move from those platforms to greener pastures (and 'verses), but I wonder whether there's something we could be doing better.\n\nI think \"force-feeding\" is an appropriate description of what's going on here. Personally, I'll be blocking anti-patterns like force-feeding with tools like uBlock Origin, but we'll likely need more sophisticated tools as blocking these feeds becomes more difficult (example: the new Reddit redesign).\n\nHas anyone else noticed any similar anti-patterns or user-hostile behaviors that are slowly becoming hard to notice? I wonder how many hours of my life have been lost to \"auto-play next\", \"related content\", and useless comments all over the web.",
