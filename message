It doesn't sound like we ever want to revert to JS, and [sodium-prebuilt](https://github.com/mafintosh/node-sodium-prebuilt) (?) doesn't seem like it's up-to-date. The latest supported Node ABI is 57 (released May 2017), so it sounds like we'll be at Electron 2 for the forseeable future. Could that be right?\n\nSorry about busting `master` with the Electron change, fixing ASAP!",
