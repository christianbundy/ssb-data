I don't want to give the impression that we should judge an ecosystem based on one data point. Maybe a better way to put it:\r\n\r\nI'm interested in the technology in the IPFS ecosystem (cannot stress this enough!), but the community's social fabric and governance is especially important to me. It feels like most of the community spaces I've seen are Protocol Labs spaces, and most of the discussions I've seen are about technical discussions (or people asking for help using IPFS libraries). Where should I be hanging out to get a feel for the rest of the community?",
