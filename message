I've only read the first few posts but I've learned a lot, what a cool resource.\r\n\r\n> What sort of icon are you trying to make? I could take a try at it if youâ€™d like.\r\n\r\nI was trying to make a favicon for Oasis. Right now I'm just starting the `<title>` with the [desert island emoji](https://emojipedia.org/desert-island/), which looks like a favicon in a regular tab, but I realized that it doesn't show when you pin the tab. I spent like 30 minutes and the best I could come up with was:\r\n\r\n![Pixelated image of a blobby tree on a beach with some water](&I9iXeNn1cl3NQPh0oKTaAUicwPA9PfvgP/Bdkrsb9Hg=.sha256)\r\n\r\nI was thinking I'd just take the [Noto Emoji SVG](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji/blob/master/svg/emoji_u1f3dd.svg) and turn it into a favicon, but maybe pixel art would look better? ðŸ¤·\r\n\r\nIf you have free time and interest I'm sure I'd love anything you make, but it's not anything urgent and I don't want to make my pipe dream your problem.",
