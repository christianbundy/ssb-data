I didn't notice that the name and corresponding ID was being passed in `value.content.mentions`, but that makes it *way* simpler. I was under the impression that I'd have to check every possible combination of characters after `@`, but that massively simplifies the problem.\n\nAre there any clients that *don't* pass an array of mentions? Seems like a find and replace might do the trick here.",
