It looks like the Everlife node software is a fork of https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork which has the AGPL-3.0 license, which requires the source code to be released on request.\r\n\r\n> **Charles:** Hey @Powersource ! We sure can make the source code available to you. Let me get it up on github or something. In any case we always planned to be open source as we went ahead.\r\n\r\n> **Powersource:** @Charles Thanks, just mention me when it's up ðŸ™‚\r\n\r\n(I added a *thumbs up* reaction to the above post)\r\n\r\n> **christianbundy: @Charles It would be great if you could provide the corresponding source in the same way through the same place (in the GitHub release). I see that there's a link to \"source code\", but that isn't the corresponding source used to build the binaries.\r\n\r\n",
