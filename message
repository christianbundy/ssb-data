I'm super inspired by the no-JS policy, and I love how powerful Patchfoo is.\r\n3. I'd love to be able to build Patchfoo from source without having to know about things like git-ssb and ssb-npm. I love the text-focused design, and I'd love to see more time spent on the composition/formatting/layout.\r\n4. Haven't used it enough to say!\r\n5. \" \"\r\n6.
