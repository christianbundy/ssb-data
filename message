Really appreciate you trying to make the gathering! In my experience private gathering are hard because clients support is very poor. \n\nMost of the time if you have to run a command-line utility to do something on Scuttlebutt you can expect that clients are usually going to have a hard time understanding it. These utilities are *awesome* for trying out weird and experimental stuff but their compatibility isn't going to be too great. We'll probably need to make a new gathering in the future since this one is still encrypted for me. ",
