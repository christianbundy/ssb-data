I've read a lot of the science (not much of the opinion pieces) and as far as I'm aware the only place where animal agriculture is superior is where human-edible food doesn't grow (e.g. some grasslands where fruits/vegetables fail). I was also under the impression that vast amounts of soy and corn went straight to feeding animals, which has [various efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_conversion_ratio), but all of which were more ecologically efficient than animal agriculture. :seedling:\n\nI'm not arguing for monocrops of soy and corn, but as far as I'm aware there's really no case where non-vegan food is more sustainable or eco-friendly than a comparable vegan option. Are there any cases that you can think of? ",
