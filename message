Electron made a big breaking change and gave us three options:\n\n- Ask users to `setuid` on the `chrome-sandbox` binary so that it runs as root.\n- Ask users to enable a kernel option via `sysctl`.\n- Add the `--no-sandbox` flag, which doesn't seem to be compatible with AppImage (or our build pipeline).\n\nThe best recommendation I've seen is something [like this](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/4278), but it would add complexity *plus* I'm not sure that it'd even work with AppImage.\n\n> Please fix it in a new release. Thanks.\n\nDo you have any suggestions on how you'd like to see this fixed? I understand that it's inconvenient (trust me, [I'm the person who opened the original Electron issue](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/17972)), but I don't see a way to resolve the problem.\n\nAside: it looks like [the `.deb` release can have `--no-sandbox` appended](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/pull/4364), but that doesn't work via AppImage (and I'm not even sure that disabling the sandbox is the right move).",
