    "text": "> Could be a small income stream to people who have time to run pubs but maybe could use some funds?\n\nThis could be a terrible awful idea, but the first thing that came to my mind was a pub specifically for OpenCollective supporters. The SSBC benefits from the financial suport and a high-uptime pub, and supporters would get access to a rando-free pub. I'm a bit skeptical of this idea, since it sounds like \"social centrality as a service\", but I'm going to post it anyway because I'm not completely convinced either way."
