For example, let's say Alice is a user, Bob is a viewer, and Carol is the recipient.\n\n1. Alice wants to share a cat photo with Carol.\n2. Alice sends a private message to Bob with the cat photo.\n3. Bob replies with a link to the private message on the web viewer.\n4. Alice sends the link to Carol.\n5. Carol opens the link in a web browser.\n6. Bob retrieves the content and sends it to Carol.\n7. After 5 downloads or 24 hours, Bob deletes the blob(s).\n\nThis means that Carol's view of the network is dependent on what Alice can see, not what Bob can see, and *also* means that randos can't search/scrape the network from the web. I'm not sure whether this is a good idea, but something with a similar shape has been banging around in my head for a few days. Regardless, it seems like there are only a few important things:\n\n1. Alice should be able to share content with Carol.\n2. Bob should be able to act as an intermediary.\n3. Randos shouldn't be able to scrape the whole network from the web.",
