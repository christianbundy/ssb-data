You create currency by saying \"you can redeem this for 1 beer from me\", which you can pass around to your friends who can get the beer from me instead. The value comes from the trust that I'll actually supply a beer in the end, so you don't need any central infrastructure to guarantee that.\n\nAm I tripping? I'm probably tripping.",
