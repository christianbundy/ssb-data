I'm not sure what happened here, but I'd recommend making a backup of your gossip file. Also, it turns out that `sbot gossip.reconnect` doesn't resolve the issue for me anymore. This is the command that worked for me (after I copied my old `gossip.json` over):\n\n```sh\n< ~/.ssb/gossip.json | jq '.[] | \"\\(.host):\\(.port):\\(.key)\"' | xargs -L 1 timeout 10s sbot gossip.connect\n```\nAfter running the above command my gossip has been working normally again (for about 5 minutes). This likely isn't the case, but it *feels* like a clog in a physical pipe where everything seems fine after removing the clog. Very frustrating, as it's especially difficult to debug. I'm tracking this as https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot/issues/579, fingers crossed this was a one-off problem!",
