    "text": "Thanks for bringing this up [@dan](@NeB4q4Hy9IiMxs5L08oevEhivxW+/aDu/s/0SkNayi0=.ed25519), I have a deep appreciation for how you focus so deeply on such important topics. ‚ù§\n\nI've seen this discussed a few times before and in my experience the conversation tends to circle the drain until we end up in the same place: [prejudice plus power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice_plus_power) (also on [Social Justice Wiki](http://sjwiki.org/wiki/Prejudice_plus_power)).\n\n- Some people were taught the conventional perspective on racism that it means **prejudice**. This lens gives the viewer the impression that racism against white people can happen, although can be deprioritized because of this *totally separate thing* called **power**.\n- Some people were taught a new perspective on racism that it requires both **prejudice** and **power**, and this lens is very common in academic and anti-racist circles. This lens gives the viewer the impression that racism against white people is usually/often/always a contradiction in terms, although they usually agree that \"prejudice against white people\" exists.\n\nIn my mind this topic is a combination of three questions:\n\n- Can you enact prejudice against white people? \n- Can you enact both prejudice and power against white people?\n- Is power a prerequisite for racism (or: should we accept the Bidol redefinition)?\n\nThis doesn't even start to touch on what *white* means, but that's a topic for [another thread](%NRVunls/zbblDoXVXwjxVe3ZSbUvobnCtk/wmbFbYCE=.sha256).
