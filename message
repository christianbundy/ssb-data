If it refuses to install because of the optional dependency (!), you may be able to append `--no-optional` to your `npm install` command.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, I'm building [Electron installers](https://github.com/fraction/oasis/pull/42) for drag-and-drop installations. It doesn't actually use Electron for anything, but it's the only way I've learned to reliably build cross-platform installers.\r\n\r\n> Thanks for all you do! Iâ€™d send you some awesome vegan chocolate cookies but I think you have access to a very skilled baker.\r\n\r\nThanks! It's the thought that counts. The next time Kathleen makes cookies I can pretend that you had some part in making them. ðŸ˜¬",
