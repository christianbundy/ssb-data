    "text": "It's coronavirus season and lots of protestors aren't maintaining distance or wearing masks. Being in a crowd feels irresponsible, so I've been making signs to put on the balcony.\r\n\r\nOur apartment is directly on the path that the marchers have been taking, so I've been going outside to show some support, but I've noticed that it feels kinda bad to show support from a balcony when everyone is marching on the ground.\r\n\r\nI thought maybe instead of joining The Protest I could hang at a nearby major intersection during rush hour with some simple \"black lives matter signs\". This felt... worse, and I'm still unpacking why that is.\r\n\r\nAlmost everyone who drove by was supportive and honked or waved or gave me a üëç, which should have felt good, it made me feel like I was grandstanding or asking people to pat me on the back stating the obvious. I really didn't expect to feel this way, but not being in a big group really made me super self-conscious.\r\n\r\nRandom thoughts:\r\n\r\n- Assuming there's actually a problem that my brain is alerting me to, does being in a group solve that problem? Or does it just make the feeling go away?\r\n- Is the problem that my message isn't challenging the majority of people, and therefore not moving the Overton window?\r\n- Or maybe it's that my message isn't directly actionable, like \"call your senator\" or \"vote for Sarah Iannarone\" or \"stop calling the police for non-violent crimes\" or something?\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, it felt good to interact with other people who had signs and were protesting, and it also felt good to contradict a \"all lives matter\" counter-protestor (what a bore), but getting support from people in cars felt like we were pandering to each other.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'd love to hear thoughts, feels, or similar experiences. Emotions are weird.\r\n\r\n‚ù§\r\n\r\n#uspol #black-lives-matter #feels",
