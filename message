    "text": "Thanks a lot everyone! :hearts:\n\n[@nanomonkey](@+D0ku/LReK6kqd3PSrcVCfbLYbDtTmS4Bd21rqhpYNA=.ed25519) You caught me! This was actually a few days ago, I got the number by chance and thought it'd make for a cool photo. Admittedly I was still 25 in the photo, and as you'd imagine I look *totally* different now. :older_man: \n\n[@dan](@NeB4q4Hy9IiMxs5L08oevEhivxW+/aDu/s/0SkNayi0=.ed25519) Very accurate photo of me from my birthday eve. I ate chili, chips, pizza, BBQ brussel sprouts, stir fry, and way too much cake. Yesterday was rough, but I'm feeling human again.\n\n [@kp](@LVL4qjvmws3Cxavfi4iCQI6dSOqWqOyq5/5CHImILA8=.ed25519) Totally intentional, all part of my master plan!  \n\n[@neale](@J233HHh6iMA7LxT+KnCbtI3GeaCJ7gW7dkB/63ObSJY=.ed25519) I'm still just dumbfounded that it comes out looking so clean. I'm also surprised at how many of them look like Pepsi logos, but that's neither here nor there.",
