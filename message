Maybe I did? My memory is really really bad.\r\n\r\n> I think the big things missing then are still the big things missing nowâ€¦\r\n\r\nThanks, I don't think I've seen that list before.\r\n\r\nMy feelings about this are getting stronger every day, and the trajectory seems to be \"I don't want an SSB implementation that takes more than a few days to write from scratch\". I'm feeling very optimistic that we only need a very very very small fraction of the existing code, if any.",
