In your experience, what's the best way to resolve the pain points we discussed *without* causing problems you mentioned? For example, I'd imagine (?) nobody would be bothered by closing issues that are 10 years old, so I wonder whether it's just a matter of *when* to close stale issues.\n\nAfter we talked yesterday I wrote [this post](%lT+mBsH9pD82FSj9hligwsLHlqRGbzpOQ9pXm+qwzKI=.sha256), where I described some problems with the status quo and dreamed about the potential for a [village issue tracker](%ZyZge6x3sXi4kROFfhnGs8URgPEDq1thPjC0D8tPfms=.sha256), so *really* my goal is to survive GitHub until we can build a better future. If you have time, I'd love to hear your opinions on both \"how to make GitHub suck less for everyone\" and \"how to make team todo lists better *in general*\".",
