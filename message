For what it's worth, I'm sure I'd buy *any* of you a drink or foodstuff because gifts are fun and sharing is good. Really, it's probably more akin to an IOU voucher (is that a loan?), and food/drinks are my *personal* go-to currency when asking friends to help me work on little projects. I'm not attached to the implementation, and I'd love to hear what others come up with!\n\nMaybe it would've made more sense to use a less-intimate currency like fiat currency or  cryptocurrency? My goal is to have and use a subjective system of sharing wealth in a way that doesn't require the permission of a government or an internet connection. ",
