I didn't merge your patch because it wasn't backward-compatible, and I after spending tons of time and energy specifying a standard I don't want to break compatibility unless there's a reason to do it.\r\n\r\nI share your frustration that the URI specification we wrote doesn't work as a Firefox extension, but I'd like to understand what the problem is before choosing a solution.",
