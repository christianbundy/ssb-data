I would rather build that … and I anticipate that’s gonna be a pretty full on piece of design (even once the back end is done). What about you?\r\n\r\nI'm on the same page: I've got other work that I'd like  to prioritize, and the work I've already finished is basically all the time I have to spend on the problem right now.\r\n\r\nI'd like to continue our hill-climbing algorithm (\"drunken stumble to greatness\") where we ship what we have and improve it over time, but if you think this change will cause more harm than good (\"drunken stumble off a cliff\") then maybe sheltering in place is our best option.",
