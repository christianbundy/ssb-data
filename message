    "text": "# Scuttlebot JavaScript module renamed to ssb-server\n\nIn the same spirit as [the ssb-db rename](%Baxk971HDDPZGYD3cggUSq5Ts/ZD2eiseCUShi4Rf4Y=.sha256), I wanted to post an update that the scuttlebot JavaScript module has been renamed to ssb-server. **This thread should serve as a forum to discuss, improve, air grievances, and give feedback on this change**. \n\n## Migration\n\nMigrating from scuttlebot to ssb-server should be painless and simple:\n\n- If you're up-to-date with scuttlebot@13.2.2, modify `package.json` and any module imports to reference ssb-server.\n- If you're behind, upgrade to ssb-server@13.2.2! The old module will continue indefinitely, but I'd recommend upgrading when possible. :wink: \n\n### Deprecation\n\nSince `ssb-server server` doesn't make much sense, the new subcommand is `ssb-server start`. The commands `sbot server` and `ssb-server server` won't be dropped until *at least* 14.0.0 to preserve backward-compatibility, so there's no rush, but it's something to be mindful of in the future.\n\n## Again?!\n\nI think this should be the last one. Check out [the original thread](%BIn4rQl8o7PxeolhiZCw77fUN5gGpOv6I3gDXhMfP+M=.sha256) for more context, but the only potential future changes mentioned would be to carve out something shaped like ssb-cli (which I don't think anyone has discussed [yet] (?)).\n\n#ssbc #ssb-db #scuttlebot ( #sbot ) #ssb-server",
