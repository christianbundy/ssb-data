    "text": "After the [fire alarm debacle](%f9BEp/3LxpKYXL6IFya0EpuKCa8GsaZqaBAexe+svqI=.sha256) two months ago both the cats have been extra sensitive to loud noises. Last week the smoke detector in the living room started loudly beeping \"low battery\" once a minute (!), and after replacing the batteries it *kept going*. It turns out that the only way to get it to re-check the battery levels is to hit the \"test button\", which makes both alarms sound **very loudly** and cycle between:\r\n\r\n- beep beep beep\r\n- low battery\r\n- fire, fire, fire\r\n- carbon monoxide detected\r\n- beep\r\n- beep\r\n- beep\r\n- beep beep beep\r\n\r\nFun.\r\n\r\nA few days later the smoke detector in the bedroom started doing the same thing, so we got to traumatize the cats *again*, and then today the smoke detector in the living room was back to it's \"low battery\" bullshit. WHY?!\r\n\r\nPSA: It turns out that [rechargeable batteries might not be a great idea for smoke detectors](https://diy.stackexchange.com/a/143480), because the voltage quickly drops and the smoke detector thinks that the battery is low. Just popped non-rechargeable batteries into both smoke detectors and I'm crossing my fingers that I don't have to think about these things for at least a few months.",
