You install SSB on another device to make a new identity, and you can have each of your identities follow eachother.\r\n2. You can't, but it's being worked on in Oasis [here](https://github.com/fraction/oasis/issues/267).\r\n3. Yeah! Are you thinking of importing and exporting a single feed via USB? Or something else? \r\n4. Yeah! You can use something like [SSB-CLI](https://github.com/fraction/ssb-cli) and run `ssb createLogStream` for all of your data. More commands with `ssb --help`.\r\n5.
