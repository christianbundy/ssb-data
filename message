It looks to me like the [ssb-first-aid-kit builds are succeeding](https://travis-ci.com/ssbc/ssb-first-aid-kit/builds), is that all working as expecting?\r\n\r\nIt looks like the [ssb-backup-tool](https://travis-ci.com/ssbc/ssb-backup-tool/jobs/254297816/config) is failing because of some changes to the `.travis.yml`, could you revert as many of those changes as possible? Specifically, it looks like it's running `npm run release-ci`, which targets *all* installers, whereas we want the default behavior where each OS builds an installer for itself. \r\n\r\nIf we do this, then we can avoid things like *building a Windows installer with Linux* so we can avoid Wine and all sorts of other pain points.\r\n\r\nIf you want I'd be down to keep troubleshooting asynchronously *or* we could do a synchronous text chat or call. Whatever works best. ‚ù§",
