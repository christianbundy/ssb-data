    "text": "I think this depends on what constitutes a \"public viewer\".\n\n- The public can use MVD to see any post with a web browser.\n- The public can use Patch(work|bay) to see any post with Electron, Chromium + Node.\n- The public can use Patchfoo to see any post a web browser and Node.\n\nI don't have any hard answers, but it seems like there are only two differences between MVD and http://viewer.scuttlebot.io/:\n\n- required JavaScript\n- generated keypair\n\nI wonder what the majority of non-technical SSB users think \"public viewer\" means, and where the line is drawn on the continuum of the viewer, MVD, Patchfoo, and Patch(work|bay). Is remote hosting the only factor that constitutes a \"public viewer\"? Hmm."
