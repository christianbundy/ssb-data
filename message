Will the application be able to handle different versions of the same package? They will probably have a different API, or even behavior.\n\nI don't see why not. As long as you aren't passing `debug` from `a.js` to `b.js` and expecting that it will have the same API I don't think this would cause any problems. I think we may be coming at this from different angles: I'm assuming that developers working on large projects (i.e. anything big enough to require the same dependency in multiple places) are keeping their packages up-to-date with mechanical edits rather than modifying `package.json` by hand. For example, I'll use `npm-check -u` every few days to make sure everything is up-to-date, and if it isn't I'll just select which updates I want and then verify them with `npm test`. \n\nI suppose my point is that there are generally two types of projects:\n\n- Tiny projects that don't require the overhead of `package.json`.\n- Non-tiny projects where dependencies are handled mechanically.\n\nI suppose another benefit is that people working on non-tiny projects but still editing `package.json` (or gods-forbig `package-lock.json`) by hand will find out about the wonderful world of automation! I might try to implement this on a rainy day sometime, just for fun, so I appreciate you kicking it back and forth with me. ",
