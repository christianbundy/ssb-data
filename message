It was good chatting with you on the phone last night though, I got some more more clarity around this.\r\n\r\n> here are a bunch of advantages in that path - it can be used straight away\r\n\r\nIn the docs, I see:\r\n\r\n- \"you can only create links between your feedId and profiles at the moment\"\r\n- \"TODO - in future add multiple authors. This will involve adding some Access Control options to the schema\"\r\n\r\nDoes this mean that you can create a profile, but only one feed can be added to it? Maybe a better question: can I replace [this implementation](https://github.com/fraction/oasis/pull/413/files) with SSB-Profile today, or do we need a bit more elbow grease before it's ready to be plug-n-play?\r\n\r\n> it will be easy to upgrade to use private-box-2 \r\n\r\nWhat's the difference between implementing this with the simple same-as vs SSB-Profile? My understanding is that the implementation I have would specifically work really well with private-box-2, but maybe not? I'd love more inf on this.",
