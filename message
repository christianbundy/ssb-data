When I was super into octet truss designs I experimented with a [tent-y thing](%3cSwFqVlWuJelhoMKmnr3VLoN9TN94IUM/+jB/81twM=.sha256) that used joints made of vinyl tubing, but it was super janky.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing you probably know this, but if you want designs / calculators / etc online, they're often called \"geodesic domes\". Tons of geodesic dome calculators and resources are available, but I haven't made one so I can't comment on which are the best.",
