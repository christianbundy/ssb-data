We should prepare not because we are facing a doomsday scenario out of our control, but because we can alter every aspect of this risk we face as a society.\r\n>\r\n> That’s right, you should prepare because your neighbors need you to prepare—especially your elderly neighbors, your neighbors who work at hospitals, your neighbors with chronic illnesses, and your neighbors who may not have the means or the time to prepare because of lack of resources or time.\r\n\r\n#coronavirus #covid-19",
