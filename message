I know that every once in a while I'll need voice calls, but I'd really like to be able to do them on any device rather than just the Google-flavored computer I call my \"phone\".\r\n\r\nI'd love to continue using Signal, so I'd need to keep the SMS flowing, but I *think* I'd be happy with just a data plan. Any chance you have experience with using Twilio? I've used them in the past when I had a call box on my apartment where I had to answer and press `9` to let people in -- kind of a fun exercise in [very simple] automation, but I'm sure it's not all that easy.",
