I'd like to experiment with [this](%UEdB/Ya8+QjmowLt7idgBXNF4Ij1del8Ot5Q8jrTj0Y=.sha256), but it seems like I should try another approach. I'm actually super jealous of how great Git is at this problem, it's exciting that you can `git fetch` and it magically downloads everything you need from a remote.\r\n\r\n[@andré](@QlCTpvY7p9ty2yOFrv1WU1AE88aoQc4Y7wYal7PFc+w=.ed25519)\r\n\r\n> I’m a little bit concerned about following your account from my phone (not an issue on my desktop) if you’re going to put tons of big repos in git-ssb…\r\n\r\nYep, me too -- I'm trying to make my feed smaller (via private follows), not bigger. I'd be very hesitant to add anything big, and was hoping that it'd just post something like:\r\n\r\n- type: git-push\r\n- root: X (first commit in repo)\r\n- HEAD: Y (latest commit in repo)\r\n\r\nFrom there it seems like it'd be possible to negotiate a packfile over MuxRPC or something instead of publishing blobs to the log, but if we use the blob sub-protocol that's a non-starter.",
