When re-downloading your profile you'll only want two files in `.ssb`: `gossip.json` and `secret`.\n\nIf you have `gossip.json` you can simply create `.ssb` with those two files, start a client, and it should work perfectly. If you have to re-generate your gossip file, then you'll want to delete *everything else* from `.ssb` before starting it up with your real `.ssb/secret`. I've been #marooned a few times and posted the fix [in this thread](%fJybUrX0Et7GegATl+/KmNoEsOTTlrQNXbBKTCYHEkg=.sha256).\n\nI believe the problem is that you switched out the secret and gossip files, but didn't delete the other files and directories in `.ssb` before starting with your real identity.\n\n> Or did it mess up things deeper, like forked the feed or something? (told you this was a noob q)\n\nYeah, any messages you posted before your feed was fully downloaded were on a fork, and weren't replicated. I talked to myself for *weeks* before noticing, which was a super frustrating experience.",
