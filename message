    "text": "This was something that Cinnamon and I discussed *lots* while working on Oasis. It seems like there's a trade-off to be made between privacy and connectivity, which sucks. The solution I was most excited about was to use a DHT/relay/etc to only connect to your absolutely most trusted peers, relying on the magic of gossip to do the rest. To be honest I was inspired by how Animal Crossing has 'best friends', who have a few special privileges and are managed in a small private list. Opening a DHT with anyone you have a private message with seems dangerous, and I'd honestly be comfortable leaking my IP to very few people on here.\r\n\r\nPrevious similar thread: %MpMMb9pgSbhhUtsqGyXCssZx8XrAb3dlRHLtMhrvdb8=.sha256",
