I think it's the first time I've made bread and I used this recipe: https://www.jocooks.com/recipes/no-knead-bread/\n\nThe only difference is that I added a few tablespoons of sesame seeds and a teaspoon of sesame oil just to see how it tasted.\n\nIn the future I think I'll double the batch size so it comes out more round, or maybe I'll use an actual bread pan? We buy bread every week so it'd be really fun to make it ourselves.",
