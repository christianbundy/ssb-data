I’ve spent a major chunk of my time alive in this earthly vehicle building technology grounded in a specific set of values: \r\n\r\nTo be explicit: thank you. I think you're doing good work and as far as I can tell we're all doing our best to make a positive dent in the universe. I'd be happy to buy you an [insert beverage here] if you're ever in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n> A person you’ve followed on Scuttlebutt comments in a conversation with ideas for some Patchwork changes, and you like their suggestions so engage in the conversation. Later in the thread they link to their Gab profile. You now block them. They can still participate and you can still participate, but you will not see their posts. \r\n\r\nI really wouldn't like to argue, but I'd feel bad if I didn't note an important distinction: in the SSB model, I can publish a comment like \"hey maybe we shouldn't collaborate with this person\" and my comment is visible to all of my peers in the context that I published it.\r\n\r\nIn the IPFS forum, that kind of discussion is moved to an 'off-topic' thread where it isn't allowed to influence the main thread. **The entire point is that I want to influence the main thread**, and it feels wrong to separate the social/political discussion from the technical discussion.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm happy to chat about this as much (or as little) as you'd like, in public or in private. I'd imagine we have way more to agree about than to disagree about. Hope you have a nice weekend!",
