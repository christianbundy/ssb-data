I wonder how many unknowing decentralists have been seduced by gab / voat / etc when looking for alternatives to conventional social media.\n\n> like the point of #mastodon isn’t that if you don’t like the rules of a server, pack up your posts and move\n\nCan you bring your followers with you? I know you can pin a post to your old profile saying \"I'm moving, please follow @me@whatever.social\" but it seems like there's still a large social cost to switching instances. I'd be super curious to hear whether this is a problem being worked on or just a pain point I've experienced.\n\n  ",
