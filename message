I appreciate the reminder, I know it's easy to slip up and burn out.\n\nSincerely though, I feel like my work on deletion has been moving at a healthy pace and I feel *really good* about the all-around support that the Verse team is providing. The \"I've just got to get this release out\" marathon with Patchwork was a personal side-project where I felt it was super important to get Patchwork in a good state, but if you see me working on deletion / off-chain content / same-as / etc I promise I'm doing it in a healthy way.\n\nIf you see me opening pull requests in the middle of the night trying to shrink the Patchwork binaries then that's a different story... üòà I don't anticipate that happening though.\n\nOne thing I'd love guidance on is how to help with triaging issues (e.g. [#1052](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork/issues/1052)) -- Patchwork seems to operate as a canary for problems deeper into the stack (e.g. [multiserver#47](https://github.com/ssbc/multiserver/issues/47) from [patchwork#1035](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork/issues/1035)) and I think it's important to respond to bug reports, but triaging everything seems to be *at least* a part-time job.\n\ncc: [@luandro](@2RNGJafZtMHzd76gyvqH6EJiK7kBnXeak5mBWzoO/iU=.ed25519) I think you're offline so you might not see this, but I wanted to explicit mention that I appreciate the bug report and you're doing everything right -- I used your issue as an example because it's the one I have open and I know you'll understand I'm talking about issues *in general*, not just yours. ‚ù§",
