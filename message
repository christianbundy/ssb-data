    "text": "Tangent: maybe instead of customizing each individual icon we could use interface language themes (paradigms)? Here are a few I thought were fun ways to show the `vote`type:\n\n- **Default:** Likes as üëç and üëé\n- **Romance:** Loves as ‚ù§Ô∏è and üíî\n- **Crabbit:** Votes as  ‚¨ÜÔ∏è and ‚¨áÔ∏è \n- **Surf:** Digs as ü§ô and ü¶à\n- **Custom:** Make your own!\n\nMaybe hiding the \"deep customization\" of being able to manually select your icons would be best hidden behind some sort of \"theme selection\" where there are reasonable and coherent defaults? I'm not sure, all I've got are thoughts."
