My strategy, in case it's useful at all:\r\n\r\n- Get a domain name and sign up with some other email service (I use FastMail).\r\n- When you sign up to new services, use the new email address.\r\n- Set up your email service to download messages from your GMail, that way you get emails from both addresses.\r\n- When you see an email addressed to your old address, and you have time/energy/interest, spend the time to log into the service and change your email to your new one. This will be slow, but it'll work.\r\n- Download everything from Google, don't even try to prune it!\r\n\r\nAfter a few years you'll stop receiving emails from your gmail address. If you want to go nuclear, you can delete the gmail account, or you can just keep it around forever just in case there's One Last Service you forgot about.",
