There's lots of AUR helpers, which build AUR packages from source, but they don't build anything from the main repository from source since they just pass through to `pacman`.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I noticed that my favorite AUR helper (yay) has a `--pacman` flag, so I wrote a small Bash utility that pretends that it's pacman but actually just builds from source instead. So you can do `yay --save --pacman absman` and then all future calls will pass through to `absman` and build from source.\r\n\r\nI'm excited to have it working!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I have two packages that I can't get to build:\r\n\r\n- python: it builds fine but the post-build test suite fails on the curses test. I think it'll be fixed once https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/17536 is merged\r\n- mesa: something about \"ERROR: C++ library 'clangCodeGen' not found\" in `meson.build`. I saw an environment variable that might fix it though.\r\n\r\nAnyway, do you have opinions about building in a chroot/jail versus just building normally? I'm sure I'll hit fewer errors if I'm compiling in a clean chroot, but I kinda like that I'm exposing these builds and tests to more surface area so that we can catch more bugs.",
