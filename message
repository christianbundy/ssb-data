I'd love to merge a PR to add it and use `ooo.get()` when we encounter a missing thread. I think the only complexity is that we'd want to remove the \"cannot load thread\" message as soon as we get the message.\n\nI suppose it might also be confusing since ssb-ooo maintains its own flumelog, so other flumeviews wouldn't index the ooo content.",
