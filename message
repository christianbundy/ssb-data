    "text": "I like *cooperative* as an adjective, but it might be wise to avoid using it as a noun unless we want to commit to [cooperative principles](https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/cooperative-identity). I think it would be especially difficult to build / maintain a democracy with subjective social graphs, although we could build cooperative entities *inside* SSB (maybe the SSBC?) if we can agree on who gets to vote.\n\nI think \"polycentric\" might be a more accurate take on how power is distributed on SSB, but I don't think that's a useful word for describing SSB to most people.",
