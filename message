I'll need to look into gitbook to try to understand how to `mv readme.md index.md` or something so that the handbook can have a readme that isn't just the index of the webpage.\n\n## ssb-server\n\n- **how would you rate the current state of the documentation out of 10?** 8\n- **is it clear what this is used for?** yes!\n- **is there api documentation?** yes! in both the readme *and* in `api.md`\n- **read code, do you see any undocumented methods?** yes, `.use()`, but that's documented in secret-stack -- should we be documenting *any* methods in ssb-server? it seems like we're mostly just passing through ssb-db + plugins and secret-stack.\n- **for a method are there any undocumented options?** yes, `getAddress()` takes an optional `scope` argument, but that's also a secret-stack thing\n\nI have weird feelings about ssb-server in general. It doesn't have any API of its own, but it exposes ssb-db + plugins + secret-stack, plus a CLI, and the readme has lots of Scuttlebutt-specific links that seem like a better fit for ssb-handbook IMO.\n\n## ssb-ooo\n\n- **how would you rate the current state of the documentation out of 10?** 9\n- **is it clear what this is used for?** yes!\n- **is there api documentation?** yes!\n- **read code, do you see any undocumented methods?** nope!\n- **for a method are there any undocumented options?** sort of, the `timeout` option is documented in the readme but doesn't actually get respected by the code\n\n---\n\nhttps://github.com/ssbc/ssb-handbook/issues/120\nhttps://github.com/ssbc/ssb-ooo/issues/5",
