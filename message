Is that enough of a differentiation?\n\nNo, because socialism isn't \"a planned economy enforced by violence\". That would be a [command economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy#Planned_versus_command_economies), which was used by the USSR but isn't a feature of socialism *in general*. \n\n> I’m really trying not to take this as a sort of put down on my intelligence, so largely going to ignore this.\n\nSorry, I didn't consider that there's cultural context here: [*For Dummies*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Dummies) was a popular book series in the US, so the title should be understood as \"Socialism 101\", or \"Intro to Socialism\", it wasn't meant to be derogatory. I should've been more mindful about making sure we had a shared context, I'm sorry about that.\n\n> socialist is a hierarchy over the participants of the planned market viewed with a contrast against libertarian-style freedom agenda\n\nI'm confused at why you're repeating your opinions in the face of new evidence. In my last message I pointed you to [libertarian socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism), but instead of integrating that new information you seem to be doubling down on the idea that socialism and libertarianism are at odds with each other. I'm not sure why that is, but since new information doesn't change your perspective I think I should respectfully bow out of this discussion. Maybe we can have a more productive convo in the future!
