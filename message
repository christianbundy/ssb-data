Our system is protected by an [n-man rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-man_rule) where you can't change anything unless you can get everyone to twist their [keys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs) at the same time. It doesn't look good, but it's impossible to know what will happen until it happens.\r\n\r\nFun.\r\n\r\nSo now we need a plan. Our plan should probably cover both bases, and provide a few different solutions:\r\n\r\n- If we face a collapse, we want systems that improve the lives of the post-collapse generation(s) of survivors.\r\n- If we don't face a collapse, we want systems that prevent the fragile behaviors we've observed in our current system.\r\n- If the world is doom and gloom and it doesn't matter what we do, we should spend time with the people we care about.\r\n\r\nI'd like to propose something radical: we're already on the right path, but we'd be wise to sharpen our vision a bit and be more explicit. **We need to build systems and structures that are resilient against the failures of existing institutions**, which are both social and technical. We need robust networks, supported from the bottom up, that provide \"progressive enhancement\" depending on how much of the existing infrastructure is still available. Not just P2P, but DIY too.\r\n\r\nI feel your pain, and I don't have all of the solutions, but I take lots of comfort in the fact that we're surrounded by good people doing lots of good work to improve the lives of people we'll never meet. Thanks for sharing these posts, it's nice to know that someone else is having the same thoughts.",
