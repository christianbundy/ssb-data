I think this is a good idea, I've been super focused on trying to avoid breaking the JS implementation but I suppose that more flexibility in this area is an option. Just to be clear, it sounds like this means that off-chain messages could be passed:\n\n- with content\n- with a corresponding deletion request\n- without either (which would be ignored by the JS implementation)\n\nThis adds a *tiny* bit of complexity, but I think you're right to avoid constraining other implementations when we can. I'll keep thinking some more about this, thanks for sharing this option.",
