How's Argentina in March? I've never been to Argentina but photos I've seen are beautiful.\r\n\r\nHave you been able to find lots of local friends interested in low-tech and offline stuff? It seems like there are tens of thousands of us online, but it's more rare to bump into each other in meatspace.",
