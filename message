My blob code is running when the flume view is being created, but [if we don't have it](https://gitlab.com/christianbundy/ssb-blob-content/blob/707efa4f1f29cdb060b9d341ccdf0d9d8475420e/index.js#L62-68) then it just passes the original `{ type: 'blob', blob: '&abc' }` message to the view.\n\nIt seems like we'd have the same problem with private messages where you get the unbox key at a later date -- if you don't have the decryption key when you originally receive the message then it seems like the view would always see it as encrypted. Is there a way to force the view to revisit a message, or some other way to modify views when new information becomes available?",
