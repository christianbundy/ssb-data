I've just put together some basic invites with [this commit](https://github.com/fraction/oasis/pull/154/commits/b5b010852da97c8d171236d21c0743426c213909), but it depends on some other PRs that add internationalization stuff, so those need to get merged first.\r\n\r\n> The other item Iâ€™m not sure on (but also havent dug into) was setting up my profile fully.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that this is also a quick thing where someone makes an 'Edit profile' link, a simple view, handlers for both GET and POST, and a model that writes the message. Should be pretty simple, I'll hop on that soon. Thanks for the feedback!",
