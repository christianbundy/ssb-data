On the implementation side this [unfortunately] requires some SSB-Friends trickery, which means that we've struggled to add it to Patchwork.\r\n\r\nI think Ratman is more like cjdns / yggdrasil, where you're forming a mesh overlay network to send arbitrary data. Basically like a distributed VPN. You could redeem an SSB invite through this, but you could also run HTTP or SSH or OpenRA or whatever you want.",
