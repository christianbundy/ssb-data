Anyone else experience this?\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that I've got lots of other unrelated stressors in my life right now that are probably increasing my ambient anxiety levels and bringing these feelings to the surface, but I guess I'm curious whether maybe others have felt similarly.\r\n\r\n#mental-health #depression #anxiety",
