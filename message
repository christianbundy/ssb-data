I keep thinking \"aw shit what if mix takes that sentence the wrong way\" even though my guess is that my anxiety is unwarranted.\r\n\r\nI feel like I have this [maybe silly] dream as SSB being a little DIY project that you can build with a couple of hand tools and a few common power tools, and SSB-Profile is like this sweet specialized tool that just *rips* through its problem space but is also something I'm hesitant to add to my toolbox.",
