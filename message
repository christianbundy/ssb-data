Public license fallbacks in the CC0 and Unlicense were designed to solve this problem, but it seems like the best solution would be an ultimately permissive public\r\nlicense.\r\n\r\nI've realized that this 'ultimately permissive public license' strategy just yields your copyright to anyone with enough time to make a derivative work, but I'm conflicted about which strategy is best:\r\n\r\n- Do you only use your copyright to stop people from asserting their own copyright?\r\n- Or do you go 'full AGPL' and also ensure that any modifications to the code are also published publicly?\r\n\r\nðŸ¤·",
