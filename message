I’m burrilove hahaha).\r\n\r\nThat wasn't me, but if you remember the problems I'd love to help resolve them or add notes somewhere so others have an easier time.\r\n\r\n> On “mentions” I can also see my own posts, this is a bit weird I think hahaha I have that on my profile already.\r\n\r\nYeah, that *is* weird. That should be fixed now though, please let me know if you experience this problem in the latest version (2.5.3). Unfortunately my fix *also* removed the ability to see your own posts when browsing a hashtag, but [it's on my to-do list](https://github.com/fraction/oasis/issues/15).\r\n\r\n> I don’t know how to follow other people\r\n\r\nYeah, this is very high on my to-do list as well. I've created a [roadmap](https://github.com/fraction/oasis/blob/master/docs/roadmap.md) of the features I'm working on right now, and once those are done I think Oasis should be a full-featured client.\r\n\r\n> Then maybe the most obvious one: I can’t create a post?\r\n\r\nThis should be fixed in the latest version too! 🤞\r\n\r\nThanks for all this great feedback, I'd love to hear if you have any pain points or suggestions after upgrading to the latest versions.",
