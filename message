I wonder how many other UI patterns we have that we've inherited from surveillance and advertising companies.\r\n\r\n> I was thinking a simple experiment might be to have a calendar view.\r\n\r\nThis is a very interesting idea! Right now I've been experimenting with a few views:\r\n\r\n- latest public posts\r\n- latest private posts\r\n- public posts with the most likes (day, week, month, year)\r\n\r\nI think we need more options to choose from, especially when it comes to how deep into our social graph we should be going. Sometimes I only want to see close friends, sometimes I want to see posts from everyone I can! The code is simple, but the UIs are hard.",
