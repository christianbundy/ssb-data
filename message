I love this idea.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of the Social Architecture section on [non-tribalism](https://hintjens.gitbooks.io/social-architecture/content/chapter1.html#non-tribalism):\r\n\r\n> Membership must be a badge to collect, not an identity. As Mr. Spock so often observed, emotions are not logical. Some groups are driven by logical purpose, and others by more emotional factors such as peer pressure, the herd instinct, and even collective hysteria. The main factor seems to be the relationship between the group and its members. We can quantify this: *Do members \"belong exclusively\" to the group?* Exclusive membership means putting the group's existence above its work. Exclusive membership ends in conflict with other groups.\r\n>\r\n> *TIP:* Stay away from formal membership models, especially those that try to convert people to belonging to the group. Allow anonymous or unidentified participation. Encourage people to create their own competing projects as spaces to experiment and learn.\r\n>\r\n> Industrial-age groups, like cults, specialize in owning their members. An employee belongs to his or her company. In some cases, even ideas you have in the shower are property of your employer. And when a group owns its members, it motivates them with emotions like fear, hate, jealousy, and anger, instead of purposeful logic. The threat of expulsion is widely used to get people to conform. \"Do what I say or I'll fire you!\"\r\n>\r\n> *TIP:* To measure how tribal a group is, just start a competing project. If the response is negative and emotional, the group is tribal. A sane group will applaud its new competitors.",
