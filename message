Even just the triage and maintenance I've been doing are pushing me closer to burnout than I'd like, and I'd hate to see anyone else have the same experience.\r\n\r\nIf a new person is having a bad time, That's A Bug, but *personally* I think I'm at my limit just trying to hold Patchwork up and take care of the critical \"I can't open Patchwork\"-style bugs.\r\n\r\nThanks for starting this discussion, it's very much worth having.",
