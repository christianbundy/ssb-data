And then they wonâ€™t see what you say. And that will be that.\r\n\r\nHave you read this person's posts? If so: why the support? I only saw their first few posts before blocking and it was nothing more than:\r\n\r\n- red-pill bullshit, complaining about women\r\n- white supremacy bullshit, complaining about \"race\" \"mixing\"\r\n- anti-Semitic bullshit, complaining about Jews \r\n\r\nI think it's important to be understanding when our friends have trouble with social cues or there are culture clashes from more argumentative styles of speaking, but this ain't that.",
