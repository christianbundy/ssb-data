I've tried hacking on both Patchwork and Patchbay and had a really hard time with both.\r\n\r\nI've taken the approach of \"I'll just make my own and make sure it's ultra-simple for others to hack on, how hard could it be?\", but most bright and shiny new clients seem to be abandoned after a few months. I guess we'll see how it pans out?",
