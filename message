I think the last one I saw was Ad Astra, which I thought was pretty good, although there were lots of \"wtf\" moments that I wasn't sure made much sense.\r\n\r\nRegarding meaning, any resources you could recommend? I recently started watching some [Vervaeke lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ) and reading some of the [Meaningness](https://meaningness.com/) website, but haven't been spending tons of time thinking about meaning lately.",
