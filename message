Get it here. ü§û**](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork/releases/tag/v3.12.0-beta.3)\n\nAll of the big bugs have been fixed, now I'd just love some help from friends who can triple-check that it works on:\n\n- Ubuntu\n- macOS\n- Windows\n\nI've only got one computer so it's hard to test other operating systems. If anyone has the time, I'd love if you could:\n\n1. Download a release for your operating system\n2. Click around for a minute to ensure that it still works\n3. Reply to this message and let me know that it's good to go üëç\n\nAs long as it opens and runs reasonably well then I'm down to ship it ASAP. There have been *so* many improvements by lots of great folks and I can't wait to release them. Thanks friends! üåû‚Äçüòé",
