I used a tape measure, a backpacking saw, a cordless drill, and some toggle bolts on some 2x2 to make a monitor stand with almost zero woodworking experience.\r\n\r\nMy intuition is that *assuming you already have access to a makerspace* it's probably just as easy to find and develop with metals, but as a guy with an apartment and an office space I'd be surprised if I have the tools to make my own aluminum beams.\r\n\r\nFWIW, the problems I've encountered so far:\r\n\r\n- My local department store doesn't have bolts longer than 3 inches (80 mm) and there aren't any hardware stores within ~1 mile. I'm using toggle bolts I found at my coworking space but there aren't even simple options on Amazon (which, of course, wouldn't be ideal anyway).\r\n- Clamps and a proper saw would probably go a long way. So far I've been holding things down with my hands and knees and just ignoring the shoddy cuts from a backpacking saw.\r\n- I don't have a rasp, which I think would be useful in cleaning up my crappy cuts. Coarse sandpaper would probably work fine, but I'd rather avoid buying disposable \"tools\" if possible.\r\n- **The biggest pain point is that I don't have a drill press**. When I get a hole that's straight and centered I'll often use it as a guide to make more holes, but the guide obscures my view of the point I'm drilling and makes it easy to drill off-center. I think a jig would go a long way but I'm not experienced enough to know what I need to build. Ideally a jig would:\r\n  - Keep my holes centered in the wood.\r\n  - Keep my holes evenly spaced.\r\n  - Hopefully be portable and usable **without taking the structure apart**. This may be unreasonable and I'd be happy with only the above.\r\n\r\nUnrelated: (cc: [@mikey](@6ilZq3kN0F+dXFHAPjAwMm87JEb/VdB+LC9eIMW3sa0=.ed25519)) what's the intellectual property status of Grid Beam™? I didn't realize it was trademarked until today, which makes me wonder whether I should be evangelizing someone else's trademark. Would it be wise to develop an open standard to describe Grid Beam™ and OpenStructures™ and other modular building systems *without* invoking a commercial trademark? Or am I being paranoid about intellectual property rights?",
