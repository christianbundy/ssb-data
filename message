I just used the [SSB-Search](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-search) plugin, which was written by Dominic. 🏎 🏎 🏎\r\n\r\n> any ETA for adding gathering-type messages? (:\r\n\r\nI'd like for Oasis to be accessible enough that anyone could add a page for gatherings ([here's a good library](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttle-gathering)), and I'd be down to pair on something like this, but if left to my own devices it'll probably be a few months. This is a nights and weekends project for me, so development is pretty slow.\r\n\r\nOnce the post views are polished up (filters and pagination, mostly) and you can edit your profile (name + description + image) then I'd really like to improve the composer (content warning, attach blob, add mention, *maybe* add emoji), but after that I think gatherings would probably be my next priority.\r\n\r\nYou can see my [original roadmap](https://github.com/fraction/oasis/blob/master/docs/roadmap.md), which is mostly accurate, and mostly done, but I've still got a few more boxes I'd like to check off.",
