    "text": "> your relationship to the project\r\n\r\nFriend. ðŸ™ƒ I think DIY P2P protocols like SSB are really fun and interesting and I love the community that gathers around them. Social software has a special place in my life and I think it enormous potential to bring people together. Also, it's a hell of a lot of fun.\r\n\r\n> in which way(s) you have a stake in the future of the SSB project\r\n\r\nI've invested a lot in the people and the technology, both of which are emotionally rewarding. After a few years of working on the tech I've started to get paid to help build things on top of SSB, but I'd be here either way.\r\n\r\n> what are the contributions you have made in the past, and\r\n\r\nI've made [lots of pull requests](https://github.com/pulls?q=author%3Achristianbundy+user%3Assbc+user%3Apull-stream+user%3Aauditdrivencrypto+user%3Adominictarr+is%3Apr) and been involved in [lots of work](https://github.com/pulls?q=involves%3Achristianbundy+user%3Assbc+user%3Apull-stream+user%3Aauditdrivencrypto+user%3Adominictarr) in the SSB ecosystem. I'm currently maintaining Patchwork, although I'm starting to burn out on it, but am **excited** to be working on Oasis (and more generally, I'm excited to be working on real problems). \r\n\r\n> what are those you might want to make in the future\r\n\r\n- Make the JS stack easier for developers to understand, repair, and improve.\r\n  - On the social side, I'd like to use something like the [Collective Code Construction Contract](https://github.com/fraction/oasis/blob/master/docs/contract.md) that we've been using in Oasis. I'm optimistic that we can make the contribution + maintenance process both easy and rewarding.\r\n- Make the SSB protocol easier to understand, implement, and extend.\r\n  - I'd like to see 'Scuttlebutt' as a family of protocols that similar protocols like Dat and Git. This should be fun and easy, but the existing JavaScript implementation makes it very hard to add support for other graphs.\r\n- Make the SSB user experience more closely match the needs of people who use it and make material improvements to themselves and their communities.\r\n\r\nWe're working on something very special, but I'm afraid that unless we make it *radically* easier to use and improve then we're going to continue burning out our friends until we're all gone.
