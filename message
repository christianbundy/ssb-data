    "text": "I've actually been considering a DIY camp shower like this for a few years. My current plan is to attach an atomizer to a water-filled fire extinguisher (which can be pressurized with a simple bike pump), ideally attached to an adjustable mount system and a handheld trigger. The steps would look something like:\n\n1. Fill fire extinguisher with desired water + air combo and mount it as high as possible.\n2. Attach bike pump and pressurize the contents of the extinguisher.\n3. Grab the handheld trigger (attached to the fire extinguisher via a small cable).\n4. Pull the trigger.\n5. Turn.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you've turned 360 degrees.\n7. Lower the fire extinguisher a few inches.\n8. Repeat steps 4-7 until you've washed your entire body.\n\nProblems:\n\n- I haven't found an easy way to attach an atomizer to a fire extinguisher.\n- I'm unsure whether you could pressurize the can enough to make \"fog\".\n- The \"handheld trigger\" thing may be needlessly complex. Maybe an on/off switch would be easier.",
