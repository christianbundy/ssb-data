Blobs, absolutely.\n\n> **Should we define the eviction policy** for blobs and threads stored in the local database?\n\nIt's currently not possible to delete feeds, check out [this thread](%okZcNVCJnXW4IiT5eLBa9qQXFabYymlDGJ7lwplbsAc=.sha256). I'm not sure which heuristic(s) we should use for removing blobs, but you can definitely delete blobs from `~/.ssb/` whenever you'd like. I think this would be a good move for folks who are low on space. My hard drive is only 64 GB and I've *personally* had no problems with SSB data, but I'm empathetic to it becoming an eventual issue.",
