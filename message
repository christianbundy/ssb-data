    "text": "> either by following a pub which follows you back or by getting on the same local area network as another butt\n\nI may be misunderstanding, but this is what I did and it forked my feed as joining a pub creates a \"follow\" post in your feed. It seems like there are three options:\n\n1. Back up `gossip.json` and don't worry.\n2. Start a client on another computer in your LAN and follow pubs with the other computer.\n3. It isn't fun.\n  1. Move `.ssb` to `.ssb.bak`\n  2. Open your client\n  3. Follow a pub\n  4. Wait\n  5. Close your client\n  6. Copy `.ssb/gossip.json` to `.ssb.bak/gossip.json`\n  7. Delete `.ssb`\n  8. Move `.ssb.bak` to `.ssb`\n  9. Open your client\n  10. Open a bottle of whiskey\n\nThere may be a way to simplify the third option, but in my experience it isn't quite as simple as \"follow a pub\" unless you're comfortable forking your feed and getting #marooned until you figure out what's going on. Took me *way* too long.",
