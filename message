Something like a pattern library? State the common problem, and the proposed pattern to solve it. With a simple reference implementation as an example.\r\n\r\nI'd really love this and would be happy to help however I can.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[@ahaproudowl](@cP1iqUv8WYGL0s/5S8Rgx4gaJYxDErKIHVqw4/aB0K4=.ed25519)\r\n\r\nI'd love to work with you on these problems, and I don't want to discourage you from Patchwork contributions in general, but since Patchwork isn't being actively developed I'd be very hesitant to have you learn all of the Patchwork-specific tooling.\r\n\r\nEven basic changes require learning *at least* the basics of [Mutant](https://github.com/mmckegg/mutant), [Micro CSS](https://github.com/mmckegg/micro-css), [Depject](https://github.com/depject/depject), and [HyperScript](https://github.com/hyperhype/hyperscript), whereas **general UI patterns/guidelines** would be helpful to all SSB interfaces. I'd be really happy to merge patches into Patchwork, but I'm hesitant to ask new contributors to learn technology that's specific to Patchwork-derived SSB interfaces.",
