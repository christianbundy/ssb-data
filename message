Our internet access is extremely limited in both bandwidth and capacity, and most of us have been spending time face-to-face.\n\nI'd love if you could unpack this issue a bit. Could you post the exact configuration that allows LAN peers to query ssb-ws? My intuition is that this would require ssb-ws to be:\n\n- enabled\n- over the network\n- with noauth\n\nFor example, an `~/.ssb/config`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"connections\": {\n    \"incoming\": {\n      \"ws\": [{\n        \"scope\": [\"public\"],\n        \"port\": 9000,\n        \"transform\": \"noauth\"\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nI'd be *surprised* if this information was being leaked with ssb-ws disabled, *or* with a seemingly secure config like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"connections\": {\n    \"incoming\": {\n      \"ws\": [{\n        \"scope\": [\"device\"],\n        \"port\": 9000,\n        \"transform\": \"shs\"\n      }]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
