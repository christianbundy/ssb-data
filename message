    "text": "# Bootstrapping the 21st century\r\n\r\nI've fallen into a rabbit hole and I can't get up. I've recently realized that I keep bumping into the same problem and I think I'd like some help either moving past it or solving it.\r\n\r\nThe basic problem: **I want to be able to make an apple pie from scratch.**\r\n\r\nYesterday I found [Recursive Recipes](https://recursiverecipes.schollz.com/), which provides recipes where each ingredient has its own recipe. (Select a recipe and move the 'time limit' slider.) Want an [apple pie in 1 minute](https://recursiverecipes.schollz.com/recipe/apple-pie?amount=0&timelimit=1&ingredientsToBuild=)? Buy one! Want an apple pie in 8 years? You're going to need soil, seeds, sea water, and cattle.\r\n\r\nThe recipe doesn't touch on circular dependencies, like the fact that you need apple seeds to plant an apple tree, or the various tools that you need (utensils, bowls, an oven (!), etc), but I'd imagine that if society collapsed that we could *probably* create something resembling an apple pie within 1 human lifetime.\r\n\r\n**How many lifetimes would it take to bootstrap our way back to the 21st century?** Computers are an easy target to think about, especially given how much of my life has been spent writing source code to run on them, but agriculture and healthcare are probably more worth targets. I guess I'm worried about how brittle the world feels right now and I want to feel like we have some idea how to get back to where we're at. Or maybe this is just a huge nerd snipe, I don't know.\r\n\r\nThe ask: is anyone working on this problem? I think the solution would look like a tech tree or similar, especially with ways to bootstrap circular dependencies. (I'd like the stone age to last 3.4 years, not 3.4 million years.) I'd also be super interested in the problems of bootstrapping governance and the distribution of labor, which I think would be a necessary ingredient for any kind of scale. Anyway, that's what's on my mind.\r\n\r\nRandom links:\r\n\r\n- [How To Invent Everything](https://www.howtoinventeverything.com/\r\n- [Bootstrappable Builds](http://bootstrappable.org/)\r\n- [I, Pencil](https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/rdPncl.html?chapter_num=2#book-reader)\r\n- [How We Got Here](https://www.andykessler.com/andy_kessler/excerpts/How_We_Got_Here_Andy_Kessler.pdf)\r\n- [RepRap](https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap)\r\n- [How It's Made](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_It%27s_Made)\r\n\r\n#bootstrapping #diy #nerd-snipe #omega-projects",
