    "text": "This has somehow started working again (?!) so if anyone wants to test you can use the `christianbundy` branch on the ssbc/patchbay repo. There have been some recent style updates that I haven't coerced into variables, so there may be *some* unthemed stuff but 99% of it should work just fine. The only gotcha is that I use my system Electron, so you may need to run `npm install electron@2.0.12` before installing the rest of the dependencies."
