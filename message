Something typical phones are not good for.\n>\n>WiPhone is also a VoIP mobile phone. It uses WIFI to make HD voice calls, for free. This means that there is no required service contract - and it's yours for life.\n\nMaybe useful? I don't think I'd like to buy another smartphone but assuming I don't buy / build a [pager](%ev6LoTts1iZqCmUkAjSMvghE9WGj9VJZPWKTSABzPko=.sha256) this seems like it might be a nice option. I'm assuming a setup like:\n\n- cell phone for emergencies, probably powered off 99% of the time\n- voip phone for basic remote communication (encrypted when possible)\n- computer for needs that aren't handled by a cell phone or a voip device\n\n#telephony #phone #wiphone #voip ",
