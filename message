    "text": "Hi friends. Been having some mental health bleh lately that's feeling under control, but there's a stigma about talking about it so I think it's important to acknowledge.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've been thinking about y'all lots and I hope if anyone else is having mental health bleh you'll reach out to a friend (maybe me?) and talk about it. Brain stuff is weird but friends are good.\r\n\r\nAnecdotal: I've noticed that people named 'Kathleen' are extra great to talk to. Sample size of 1 though, so your mileage may vary.\r\n\r\n#mental-health #feels",
