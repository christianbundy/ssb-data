There's a handful of people here who run #yggdrasil and #cjdns, I used to run cjdns but haven't been using it very often lately. I should try yggdrasil again.\r\n\r\nI think I got into SSB when I was interested community mesh networks and started asking questions like \"what do social applications look like on mesh network?\". It turns out that when you start ruling out technologies that require internet access, there aren't tons of options, so I've been hanging around these cool p2p people ever since. \r\n\r\nI should get back into community mesh network stuff though, even just getting an amateur radio license would be a good first step.\r\n\r\nDo you run yggdrasil now? Maybe that'd be fun to set up. I'm embarrassed to admit that the name scared me away.",
