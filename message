(Disclaimer: I'm biased toward Oasis because I'm working on it!)\r\n\r\nThinking about your suggestion more, I think it makes sense if you're willing to trade some resilience for multi-writer convenience. You'd have to pick a server for all of your devices to send stuff to, and if your connection fails you wouldn't be able to publish, but otherwise the only hard part would be replacing `publish()` with a function that sent your message to your preferred server. ðŸ¤”\r\n\r\nI don't want to make that trade-off, but maybe I could add a feature to Oasis where you could host Oasis on your laptop and connect to it with your other devices when you're on the same LAN? I think the only change would be adding an option for password-based auth (and probably HTTPS to guard against local HTTP snooping).",
