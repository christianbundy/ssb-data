    "text": "Thanks for all the responses! Just to clarify, my main use-case is navigating unfamiliar areas (usually meeting friends in the city or in the woods for #sar). I wasn't crazy about OsmAnd's design so I'm currently using MAPS.ME. My main pain points with #openstreetmap:\n\n- searching for business names generally comes back with no results\n- searching for addresses generally comes back with no results, although the geocoder on openstreetmap.com can sometimes pinpoint where there *should* be a building point/area\n\nIt's also [probably] worth pointing out that I think some/many/most of my problems may just be caused by having to use Android on my main mapping device. I wonder whether I'd hate using #maps less if I was running a non-Google #gnu/linux.\n\n[@emile](@2YVYXQclEJHVzCON5dsLRwf65b2S6HnvxpGS8/LwjwY=.ed25519)\nI'll try that out! I've been meaning to save my GPX on hikes, but I haven't tried yet. I just moved from #chromeos to #archlinux though, so I imagine it'll be a lot easier. :wink: \n\n [@martin ➬](@pJsYrTaEjm5XW5Qe0W9JW2c+RpYNqJHPMZ0qGFFYXfI=.ed25519)\nI want to love StreetComplete so badly, but it mostly just asks me for the street surface (always asphalt). I didn't know anything about businesses on GMaps having to buy AdWords -- am I understanding that correctly? I'll check out #komoot too!\n\n[@Luandro](@2RNGJafZtMHzd76gyvqH6EJiK7kBnXeak5mBWzoO/iU=.ed25519)\nThose are really impressive! I'm having trouble understanding the intended use-case (if there _is_ a super-specific use-case), but I'd love to find a reason to use those! They look really great.\n\n[@Vitor](@eygl18LeuM8wrwpFm+/DRRxxP2lj1Oc+Ix4McDAQY98=.ed25519)\nI'm in the same boat re: groceries. My girlfriend likes using Google Home's grocery list whereas I've taken to using an physical journal (analog baby!) to keep track of what we buy each week. It takes a few minutes to reconcile our two lists before we go shopping, but it's worked fine for me (so far).\n\n[@noffle](@C3iYh/12sO1uvKq1KcZXLFxSySzxOkHxXN8rtNB5MGA=.ed25519)\nHave you had success getting rid of your phone? I'd love to learn more about that -- I recently jumped from Apple to Google (because \"\"\"open-source\"\"\"), but now I'm trying to continue down that path. Depending on server farms owned by huge capitalist corporations is convenient but somehow _exhausting_. Public transit is important to me, but generally I just use their website/app instead.\n\nTo your second point, I think I may just be in a period of adjusting my expectations. Being exploited can be _so_ personally convenient, so I'm sure that as the community responsibility to maintain our own maps becomes more intuitive that I'll stop comparing OSM and friends with Google and co.\n\n[@juul](@22YV3HX/BGClXH49ZebkcepqRpj7a9f5s0ddwhDSfxk=.ed25519) \nSame, except there aren't any official LineageOS images for my phone. :disappointed: \n\n[@sam_uk](@4xqgty3pil6QW3CoO1RcuTFGRuhsTcp+jGZvA6aCSAo=.ed25519)\nSimple! I like it.\n\n[@Joey Hess](@BCM6DHYJvWzwWi1lFl2tjDXjaqyZAEmJH5ZONSpXhtc=.ed25519)\nI'll give OsmAnd another shot, I didn't know they did the Wikipedia excerpt! ",
