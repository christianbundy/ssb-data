Agriculture contributes to [less than a third of global emissions](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data#two), and [at least in the US] animal products are heavily subsidized by the government. \r\n\r\nI strongly agree with you that it's helpful for individuals to reduce their consumption of animal products, but I'm not sure I understand the negativity toward people who try to  influence government policy.",
