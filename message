I think there's some overlap, but the Community Technology site has tons of resources around and Detroit Community Technology is super rad. My fav is the [Teaching Community Technology Handbook](https://detroitcommunitytech.org/?q=content/teaching-community-technology-handbook), but they might have something better for learning instead of teaching.\r\n\r\nIf you find any good resources I'd love if you shared them!",
