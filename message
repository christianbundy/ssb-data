    "text": "There are lots of worrying videos that came out of the national protests yesterday. Calls to end police brutality are being met with police brutality, which I hope spurs *more* protest rather than less. It feels like we're really spiraling over here.\r\n\r\nThere weren't many big conflicts between police and protestors in Portland last night, so that's good, but I don't like that the protests are being guided by 'Demonstration Liaison Officers' who try to turn the protest into a parade.\r\n\r\nI guess most of my thinking right now boils down to this: we need community self-defense, but that doesn't need to look anything like the police.\r\n\r\nI think \"abolish the police\" might be too spicy, but there are lots of steps in the right direction:\r\n\r\n- Disarm the vast majority of police officers.\r\n- Police who escalate and attack peaceful protestors should be arrested. Cops should be held to a higher standard, which is very different from \"above the law\".\r\n- Throw away the ideology of \"thin blue line\" policing and the wall of silence. 'Good cops' who don't report 'bad cops' are bad cops. \r\n- Fire bad cops. Do not re-hire them. Do not relocate them to another police force.\r\n- Stop patrolling neighborhoods, wait for a 911 call just like every other first responder.\r\n- Traffic cops should look like parking enforcement cops. Moving violations shouldn't be used as the first step in an investigation into mystery crime. They shouldn't even *ask* to search my vehicle.\r\n\r\nIt's unlikely that any of this will happen within my lifetime, but I'm optimistic that a better world is possible.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: Police brutality is bad. Black lives matter. We should improve society somewhat.",
