Currently, most of us don't show up on https://viewer.scuttlebot.io, but IMO this gives the impression that these conversations are private, which is bad. It'd be like Bitcoin explorers that didn't show transactions unless you opted into it -- sure, a nice thought, but potentially dangerous for folks who misunderstand this as \"transactions are private unless I opt into public logging\". Do you think requiring opt-in for public viewers is a net postive or negative from a privacy perspective?",
