This is so ludicrously user hostile that it’s only tenable when you operate a monopoly. Break. Them. Up.\r\n>\r\n> Hey, let me pitch you on this new search engine. Users enter a term they’re looking for, and, get this, instead of showing them results, we will show them a full-page ad from whoever wants to buy that. Don’t you think users are going to love it??\r\n>\r\n> This is what monopoly abuse looks like in the age of surveillance capitalism. Google are able to raise the cognitive price on users because they’ve cornered the market. If they were not the dominant entrance, they’d never be able to get away with this.\r\n>\r\n> [...]\r\n>\r\n> Classic monopoly power: Corner the market as the front door of the internet by providing great results under a motto of “do no evil”. Once cornered, use the monopoly to shake down businesses for protection money. Cha-ching! 🤑\r\n>\r\n> -- [@dhh](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1205582897593430017)",
