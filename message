When you wake up in the morning you log into the website and it displays your rank in the \"who wakes up on time consistently\" competition and I really like it.\n  - I think the thing I enjoyed was that the community was small and you'd feel good seeing that all of your virtual peers are accomplishing their goals with you.\n  - It could be fun to build a small and experimental app on Scuttlebutt.\n  - Stretch goal: build a social todo list app for supporting your friends in their (maybe private?) accomplishments.\n- The competition wasn't really important, but while thinking about timing I considered the pain point in Scuttlebutt where that we can't determine the order of messages across the network. It could be fun to try to solve the problem.\n  - Maybe each message could reference the latest message from each of the feeds it has new messages from?\n  - I should probably do the math to see how many feed references we could fit in a message.\n\n![Flow chart showing messages from feeds A-D referencing each other as described above.](&6jwXXAONvtaoTj4x0e29P9lRy5ixc4QLotYoM039OO8=.sha256)\n",
