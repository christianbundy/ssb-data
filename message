    "text": "# flumedb.delete()\n\nThe above message was written under the incorrect assumption that `flumedb.append()` is our only interface into the flumeview API. After doing a bit more research, I think think our best bet would be to implement deletion from logs and views with some new API surface area: maybe `flumedb.delete()`?\n\n![flumedb.png](&wLzqO86OsNWTgTrlrrok/IYUbk5UsuYWYrLZLDX4fkA=.sha256)\n\nAbove I've put together my best impression of what's going on under the hood and which interfaces this might touch, and I think this could actually work. It might be useful to prototype feed deletion with flumelogs first, and if that's successful then I may start implementing it for flume views.\n\n- **flumelog-memory:** `delete log[seq]`\n- **flumelog-level:** [`db.del(seq)`](https://github.com/Level/level#dbdelkey-options-callback)\n- **flumelog-idb:** [`objectStore.delete(seq)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IDBObjectStore/delete)\n- **flumelog-offset:** will likely require work in [aligned-block-file](https://github.com/flumedb/aligned-block-file)\n\nI'm likely getting head of myself here, but from a shallow glance at the above I think this idea might actually have legs. Are there any major problems that I should be aware of while hacking on this?\n\ncc: [@dominic](@EMovhfIrFk4NihAKnRNhrfRaqIhBv1Wj8pTxJNgvCCY=.ed25519) ",
