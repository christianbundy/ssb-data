    "text": "**Another reason I run TypeScript on my JS files:** when testing [Common-Good](https://github.com/christianbundy/common-good) on Windows I realized that `npm` is actually called `npm.cmd` -- at least in Travis CI. To resolve this, I wrote a small piece of code:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nonst npmCommand = process.platform !== \"win\" ? \"npm\" : \"npm.cmd\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried to commit the change, but TypeScript yelled at me. What did I do wrong?!\r\n\r\n> index.js(7,20): error TS2367: This condition will always return 'true' since the types 'Platform' and '\"win\"' have no overlap.\r\n\r\nðŸ¤¯\r\n\r\nTurns out I should've compared against `\"win32\"`, not `\"win\"`, and TypeScript just saved me at least 10 minutes of debugging. Anyway, using TypeScript to debug JavaScript is awesome, thanks for coming to my TED talk.",
