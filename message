Just to make sure I'm not missing anything, when does that become important? I was thinking that it became important any time that you were showing the same-as links to someone else (or deciding how to encrypt a private message), but this use-case is just \"show me notifications when someone mentions these feeds\", like [@SoapDog (SPX)](@0xkjAty6RSr5uhbAvi0rbVR2g9Bz+89qiKth48ECQBE=.ed25519)'s group display. My gut feeling is that this one-way link is fine for the current use-case, but would obviously need to be treated as an unfinished link for any future features.",
