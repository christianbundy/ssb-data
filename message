Assuming they're using an AGPL license, I think they need to provide source code next to their binaries:\r\n\r\n> Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and **offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place** at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you **maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source**. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\r\n\r\nThanks for contacting them. ðŸ™Œ",
