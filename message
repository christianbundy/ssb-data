I've been aware of Radicle but didn't realize that you were going forward with using Git. I've been spending lots of time thinking about how we can leverage Git, like [exporting an SSB feed to Git](https://github.com/christianbundy/ssb-git-data) or replacing npm with [Git as a package manager](https://github.com/christianbundy/git-npm), so I'm really excited to see where you're heading.\r\n\r\nCould you point me to a Git repo that implements Radicle so that I could check it out? I'm fine if I'm missing out on some features, I just want to make sure I can understand where everything is stored in Git.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to learning more!",
