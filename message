Are you thinking we'd pool money somewhere for easy easy access or just have a simple [private?] way for friends to let us know they're in turbulent financial waters?\r\n\r\nMaybe totally different, but I'd be happy to open up some lines of #mutual-credit on SSB. For example, maybe I offer you $10 and you offer one of your friends $10, and if they take you up on your offer then I could just fund that. I think it might add a bit of complexity, but it'd eliminate the problems of having to manage a centralized pool.",
