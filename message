I'll probably try to experiment with that pattern!\r\n\r\nI went to the hardware store yesterday and picked up:\r\n\r\n- bolts, nuts, washers\r\n  - these were the longest 1/4\"-20 bolts they had (!), so I *am* very tempted to use threaded rods instead. Would you just use a washer and nut on both sides?\r\n- a square with a small lip, that way I don't have to use printer paper to draw my lines :~)\r\n- a bar clamp! I wouldn't have thought to use one without your recommendation, thanks for pointing it out as an option! \r\n\r\nI also snagged some more wood, but the dimensions are pretty wonky so I'm not sure how usable they'll be. It's a lot easier to remove wood to a piece that's too big than it is to add wood to a piece that's too small, so I should probably be more careful about measuring before buying.",
