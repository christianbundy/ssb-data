I still suck at spreadsheets, and I have a handful of gripes (VERSION CONTROL PLZ) but I kinda think of them as a programming IDE now.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I don't feel super strongly either way, so I'd love to hear what you think about them.\r\n\r\n(I never thought I'd start a Saturday morning and send a message to a friend \"hey what do you think about spreadsheets?\". Life is weird.)",
