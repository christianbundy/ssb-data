That’s be nice to have a real alternative to Github, offline first and open.\r\n\r\nIf you have time, I'd love to hear your thoughts on [git-appraise](https://github.com/google/git-appraise). Their [web UI](https://git-appraise-web.appspot.com/static/repos.html) looks similar, but that's probably because both projects use material UI components for the web interface.",
