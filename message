    "text": "Sweet, thanks for taking the time to write this up [@matt](@FbGoHeEcePDG3Evemrc+hm+S77cXKf8BRQgkYinJggg=.ed25519)!\n\nAfter poking around a bit, it seems like there are a handful of spots where `when()` is being used on values that don't seem (to my untrained eye) to be observable. I think I have a handle on *using* `when()`, but I'm unclear on when I can remove `when()` from a line of code.\n\nFor example, can I assume that any time [this `return`](https://github.com/mmckegg/mutant/blob/4cc5d7c35493700dc9a40f3cb6da6a2b6e3ce7dc/when.js#L28) is used that `when()` can probably be replaced with a ternary operation? It's funny how *removing* code is at least twice as hard as writing it in the first place, especially if you want to avoid breaking anything/everything. ",
