All of the synthetics I've tried are really lightweight fabric so they drape like sweatpants instead of jeans, which is [for some reason] something I care a bunch about avoiding. I've been wearing Outlier Strong Dungareers for a while and I haven't found pants I like more, but I'll have to try out those the next time I'm at REI.",
