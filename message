If you're having a problem specifically on Windows, and it happened very recently, it's possible [this PR](https://github.com/ssbc/multiserver/pull/57) is related?\n\nReally though, we're just treating symptoms until [multiserver#49](https://github.com/ssbc/multiserver/pull/49) is merged. Once that happens then multiserver should support `::` without any hacks or workarounds.",
