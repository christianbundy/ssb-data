Unfortunately SSB has been added to this list.\r\n\r\nIf you pass `http:abc` it says \"no, that needs to be a location\" and coerces it to `http://abc`, which is why your replace-delimiters-with-`/` hack works. When you do that, it coerces the URI to `ssb://message` and the slashes are totally valid in the path.\r\n\r\nIf you pass `http:abc:def` it errors out, because it **can't coerce it into a location**, which is exactly the problem you're experiencing with the SSB-URI scheme. My intuition is that when SSB was added as a known URI scheme, it was actually added to some list of HTTP-like URL schemes that require a location. BOOM.",
