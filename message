I've seen it pop up a few times, and I'll look forward to reading your post on the topic. No rush on that, of course, I hope my excitement for working on blob content didn't come off as pushy.\n\nI'm privy to [the basics of blobs](https://ssbc.github.io/scuttlebutt-protocol-guide/#blobs) but that's about it, so no attachment at all. I've often wondered whether managing blobs with IPFS/Dat might be an option, but again, I'll look forward to hearing your post on this if it's something you're already working on. Thanks for the quick response!",
