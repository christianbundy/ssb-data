Personally, I try to cooperate whenever possible. Competition is overrated. ðŸ™ƒ\n\nI like the idea of absolute optimal solutions, but I'm more inclined to cooperate on a *good enough* solution rather than rewrite our own. If their solution has critical problems that make it a non-starter, then I'd fully support inventing here, but I wanted to ask about alternatives. I'd love to read more of your thoughts/opinions if/when you have time. ",
