I really enjoy that when I look at a thread I can see all of the nested threads, and this makes it *very* easy to navigate sub-threads, but I feel bad because I know it's probably displaying poorly in Patchwork.\r\n2. I also really enjoy that replying to a thread doesn't automatically bump it to the top, but I feel bad that when I comment on posts it's probably bumping the threads in Patchwork which might be annoying.\r\n3. I wish there was a way for me to make \"unlisted\" posts when I'm talking to myself and using SSB as a public journal. I'd love for others to chime in, but I don't want it to appear at the top of everyone's feed.",
