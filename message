    "text": "Wow. One of my clients just received a very interesting email:\r\n\r\n> **Update In My DD Details**\r\n>\r\n> Hi <name>,\r\n>\r\n> I need an update to be done on my DD information, can i email the new bank details to you to make the changes for me right away?\r\n>\r\n> I would be glad if the changes can be effective with the coming payroll date so I can have my pay in the account\r\n>\r\n> Regards,\r\n>\r\n> Christian Bundy\r\n\r\nIt's actually sort of clever, although they should have spent a few bucks on a domain name instead of sending from their earthlink.net account.\r\n\r\nMy best guess at their steps:\r\n\r\n- Find company with a *team* page\r\n- Find the billing contact\r\n- Find a random team member (me!)\r\n- Send an email to the billing contact impersonating the team member asking for a change to direct deposit details\r\n- ???\r\n- Profit\r\n\r\nThankfully the billing contact on this team is awesome and sent me this immediately, but I'm sure that others haven't been so lucky (or attentive).\r\n\r\nStay safe!",
