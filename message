My understanding is that the behavior of `new URL()` should be as browser-specific as `atob()`. I think you're right that it's using a safelist, but I think that's a bug. The specs don't mention a safelist and they don't use the safelist for some path patterns, which makes me think that the right move is to get the problem fixed upstream.",
