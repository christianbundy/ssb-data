I don't have a bottle brush (yet!) so I put a small rag in my water bottle with soap and water and shook it up a bunch.\r\n\r\nJust be careful that you don't put anything scratchy inside of a plastic water bottle because I think microorganisms like to grow inside scratches on plastic.\r\n\r\n#cleaning",
