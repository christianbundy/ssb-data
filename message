I just got this working with flumelog-offset and it's just as simple as you described, thanks for putting me on the right track. I'm going to track my progress/learning [here](https://github.com/fraction/flumedb-delete), and I think (?) my first todo should be to ensure that the views are regenerated as well. Are there any other steps that we'd need to take before declaring a feed \"deleted\"? I suppose their blobs could also be deleted during this process, but I'm going to focus my attention on flumedb first.",
