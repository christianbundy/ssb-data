I've mentioned this before, but the default Patchwork view prioritizes conversations by activity, which means that we end up congregating in the same threads all the time.\r\n\r\nReading the latest posts without any other sorting has actually been very nice. It feels a bit like drinking from a firehose, and I'm sure that eventually I'll want some better sorting, but it's really enjoyable to have a different view of the network every once in a while.",
