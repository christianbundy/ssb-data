    "text": "# Electron, Debug, and redefining `console.log`\n\nWe're doing a thing in #patchwork and #patchbay where we redefine `console.log` to make it log to both the browser console *and* the terminal console. Historically this has been fine, but as more packages start using `debug` we're starting to have an issue with their [web browser integration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug#web-browser).\n\nLong story short, the web browser console takes color codes in a different format than the terminal, so those browser logs are being output to the terminal as a big unreadable mess. No good. The two solutions, as I see them:\n\n- stop using debug, and have our dependencies stop using debug\n- stop redefining `console.log` to output browser logs to the terminal (my preference)\n\nAnyway, I'm sure it will annoy someone eventually, so I just wanted to document both the problem and the solution. **Does anyone mind if we stop sending browser logs to the terminal?**\n\ncc: #somebody-should #patchwork-dev #patchbay-dev ",
