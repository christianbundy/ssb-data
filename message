    "text": "I love Tor and cjdns, although admittedly I haven't tried I2P. My issue with them is that most people don't have them installed, and until the Scuttlebutt onboarding process is more user-friendly I can't imagine adding a step that says \"install Tor and ensure that the SOCKS proxy is running\" or something similar. Maybe there's a way to package it with Electron (?!) but I'm just unclear on how I'd start a Tor server from inside Patchwork.\n\nThere's also the issue of root access, where I'd *personally* be uncomfortable giving my client root access so that it can modify `/etc/cjdroute.conf`. Maybe that would be a micro-app in a different process?"
