I was able to use `watch` to get it working, I appreciate your help. I noticed that the readme mentioned `value((v) => {}` as an alternative to `watch()` *without* having the code triggered, but I couldn't figure out how or where to get that variable.\n\nI tried `require('mutant/value')(userBlocksThem)`, `userBlocksThem.value()`, `userBlocksThem()` and a handful of others but I finally resorted to just checking how many times the function had been called. See [this code block](https://github.com/fraction/flumedb-delete/blob/b7a9994f1eed99631d109f7978408570b6be693b/ssb-blocking.js#L30-L42), which is called initially. What's the best way to skip that initial data load?",
