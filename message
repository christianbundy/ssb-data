The last post ( %9YZkx2q5FCJADG+C3mWnhFrDCP3VUuhq1axAiaFmyuM=.sha256) was ~17 hours ago, so it should post another one in ~8 hours. The counter-intuitive bit is that I'm waiting 24 hours *after* the UTC day ended to post the news from that day, as Wikipedia pages can recive substantial edits even hours (or *days*) after the day has actually ended. For example, the Wikipedia page for July 27th received another edit 26 hours after the day ended (two hours after [@Current Events](@wNmXqk80DL4FrBjzZcYqbKs/SpsPv6MVX6BLICabPfI=.ed25519) posted it).\n\n\nUntil we have post editing I think we'll likely have to have *some* lag so that the last Wikipedia edits have time to get merged, but I'm not sure how long that should be. Maybe there's a more elegant solution?",
