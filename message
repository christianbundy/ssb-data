I feel very strongly that anyone should be able to download the entire dependency graph from source and build / fork it without any binary blobs or copyright infringement.\r\n\r\nThe only sketchy part of Oasis (in my opinion) is that it uses the [centralized] npm registry just like every other Node.js application. I've been experimenting with [replacing npm with Git submodules](%VZRfWk/2eA5fxjyTG0Dc3SIF+9ikmH9xBI9kWDn308g=.sha256), but it's currently too rough to deploy and I don't want Oasis to be hard to install.\r\n\r\nIf you use software to double-check all of the licenses in the stack the only ones that come back as \"proprietary\" are [multicb](https://github.com/pfrazee/multicb) and [stack](https://github.com/creationix/stack), both of which now have free software licenses on GitHub (although their authors haven't updated their npm registry metadata).",
