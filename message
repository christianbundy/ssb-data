To be explicit, I don't *want* to compile a bunch of stuff from source, but if you *can't* compile your application from source then you lose out on lots of the benefits of having the source code in the first place.\r\n\r\nAfter trying to download the Git repos for all of my npm modules I'm realizing that most of us couldn't possibly hope to build our applications from source, which both bums me out and freaks me out.",
