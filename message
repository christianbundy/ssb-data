I think you can only do this from the title screen's *option* menu, so it's probably best to do this before you even start the game.\r\n\r\nI've only been using this for a few minutes, but I'm hoping it makes the menus easier to read. So far they've felt very cluttered and I can't process any of the information.\r\n\r\n#death-stranding",
