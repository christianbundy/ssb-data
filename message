I had been staying on top of my notifications at the cost of stress (/probably mental health) and recently decided to unwatch all but a few repos when I realized that these really weren't urgent. My current strategy is to receive notifications when I'm @mentioned (or there's activity on a repo I care about and feel like I can actually change things) but otherwise I just sort all SSBC + FlumeDB + DominicTarr + etc tickets by 'least recently updated' and resolve as many issues as possible.\r\n\r\n> Guess there’s a question about what it might be like for this to be “joyful”.\r\n\r\nDon't know if you saw this, but the [C4 process](https://hintjens.gitbooks.io/social-architecture/content/chapter4.html) actually seems like it might be a good fit ([actual \"contract\" here](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/)). Having explicit maintainers might be helpful to understand how much care a module has, and having expectations makes contributing much easier. I'm *still* confused about what the SSBC developer protocol is sometimes, and I've been doing this for a while.\r\n\r\nI'm down for rainbow hermes stickers, and if possible it might even be fun to print stickers for maintainers  / contributors / etc. [\"I wrote a patch and all I got was this lousy sticker\"](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndAllIGotWasThisLousyTShirt)",
