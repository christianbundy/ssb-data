I hope you'll correct me if I make any mistakes, and I'll commit to **acknowledging my mistake and correcting myself**. For the record, I'm not affliiated with Enspiral, Protozoa, or anyone else mentioned in this thread, and I don't have any strong opinions on the subject.\n\n> Can you guys publish a list of rules that everyone on this network has to abide by to not tick off Enspiral people?\n\nThis isn't specific to Enspiral, but I hope it'll help anyway.\n\nMost programming paradigms don't work well when applied to human social interaction, but I think the [robustness principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle) is an exception. Unless you're optimizing for chaos and social fragility, I'd recommend that you treat others the same (or better) than you'd like to be treated. It's okay to be wrong sometimes, and it's okay to be inconsiderate sometimes, but I can't recommend doing both at the same time.\n\nIn the same vein, **acknowledging your mistakes and correcting yourself is one of the best ways to earn respect**. Avoiding the fact that you were wrong, switching the subject, or *continuing* your prodding are surefire ways to lose respect and become alienated from a community. Even worse, you may get confused and make the accident of [attacking people who agree with you](%i+ND/ubccHGBGLReSC9C+FzKox3whTOVv0wt6pZVgTQ=.sha256).\n\nYour feed is an active node within this community, and I know you care deeply about the things we talk about, but [communities need more than just nodes](%Rr/M6shC0QoOYiWP3wrwi1FqnPTktjZSpmBKyO+X+7g=.sha256). I'd like to see you continue to develop edges with others as we build the web, but increasing edges requires more robust communication:\n\n- choosing to being more tolerant and accepting of how others communicate\n- choosing to be more thoughtful and considerate of how you communicate\n\nThere is no \"other people being more thoughtful of how I'd like them to communicate\" option, although I think we can all sympathize with those sorts of feelings. It's like the online correlary to [defensive driving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_driving), where the optimal behavior is to maintain the safety of yourself and others rather than trying to punish other people for their mistakes. To continue (ab)using the metaphor, when you make a silly mistake it's generally more optimal to wave at other drivers and say \"sorry, I thought the light was green\" rather than shouting \"I'm not apologizing for not being telephathically linked to the traffic signal\".\n\n> I'm not up for apologizing for not being telepathically linked into Enspiral HQ.\n\nThis wasn't asked of you. [You said](%8VUa+fL03gN8lSNE6PdA24bdQiwYso46sgX9Zsrs1Y4=.sha256) that other entities were less honest about their intentions, and that \"pushback from people employed at the other companies building on ssb (mostly Enspiral/Protozoa)\" was to \"maintain a monopoly position\". On the other hand, there are two expectations that nobody has:\n\n- you must know who's part of Enspiral\n- you must be right all the time\n\nYou first claimed that you knew who was part of Enspiral, which didn't seem to be entirely factually correct. You then attributed your mistake to non-telepathy, which, while technically true, is clear derailment to avoid admitting your mistake. I think this is classic example of [cutting off your nose to spite your face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_off_the_nose_to_spite_the_face). Admitting fault would have strengthened your edges and rectified your reputation as someone who can't admit mistakes, whereas derailment and further prodding have done the opposite. Even from a strictly strategic perspective, this seems sub-optimal. Given the way you've communicated with others in the past, I might recommend a [re]read of *[The Art of War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_War)*.\n\nThis isn't strictly \"a list of rules\", but I don't think that's how communication works anyway. I'm hoping this will help answer your question rather than spark another inane beef, and I'm happy to answer any sincere questions you have. Cheers.",
