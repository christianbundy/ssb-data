Would this even be a good idea? For example, here's 3-2-3:\r\n\r\n```\r\n                                             19\r\n                9                         18\r\n      4       8            13          17\r\n1 2 3   5 6 7     10 11 12    14 15 16\r\n```\r\n\r\nA plain `(3 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2.67`, but my intuition is that the calculation is probably more nuanced than that. Do you have to calculate the average group size weighted by the number of items in that group?",
