Oasis uses the same threading as Patchwork\\*, it just displays sub-threads (\"forks\") with indentation instead of making you click \"Christian forked this thread\" or whatever Patchwork's current text said. Here's a screenshot that probably explains it better:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of sub-thread being displayed with indentation](&6vuVBDWE5+xiemqer0LKYoJGbrA5UuVf4wIFhPWFqsI=.sha256)\r\n\r\n\\* One small difference is that Oasis supports commenting on a sub-thread. Patchwork publishes these messages as sibling sub-threads, which *usually* looks fine but sometimes you have two separate sub-threads resulting from the same message. This is rare, but it happens. Here's a screenshot of one of those cases, where I've started two *completely separate* conversations as replies to the same message:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot of two replies to the same message, one asking a technical question and the other where I was discussing the fact that the author had recently died](&c5etPbvX2B0RgY7M2RF/vB/N/t37Mw0Z9ms7+XHq8Ag=.sha256)",
