I agree on the transparency of the network, it makes it much harder to ignore your metadata. \n\nBy the way, I had some notes on the PR that I'd love opinions on, if you have any:\n\n> - **Icon:** I don't remember which FA icons exist, but the lock was the first thing I thought of. Are there more appropriate icons to use?\n- **Color:** Should it match the #bbb plus icon? Or maybe a green to indicate security?\n- **Decryptability:**  Currently private messages are only indicated with a lock icon if you can see their contents. I was thinking that readable private messages should have an unlocked icon, but I'm concerned that might be misunderstood as \"insecure\". We could also use color, maybe #bbb by default but green if you can read it?\n- **Text:** Hovering over the lock icon just says \"Private\", but it might be more helpful to display more text -- maybe different text depending on whether it's encrypted for you?
