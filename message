I'm happy to see that you were posting about it too.\r\n\r\n> A parent takes care of a child so that child can grow and be healthy and flourish. That's true, but at an immediate level you take care of a child so that the child can go and play. That's what children actually do when you're taking care of them.\r\n>\r\n> What is play? Play is action done for its own sake. It's, in a way, the very paradigm of freedom. Action done for its own sake is what freedom really consists of. Play and freedom are ultimately the same thing.\r\n>\r\n> [...]\r\n>\r\n> So we need to think: what are ways that we can care for each other to make each other more free? And who are the people who are providing that care? And how can they be compensated themselves with greater freedom?\r\n\r\nDIG.",
