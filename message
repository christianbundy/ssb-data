It's something you'll do locally, it's just that it isn't baked into any clients that I'm aware of yet (except maybe Patchbay?). Tools like SSB-CLI are like an *advanced mode* that lets you publish custom messages and make queries and stuff that isn't available in your client, so you can think of them as a sort of admin interface to Patchwork/etc.\r\n\r\nEventually I'm sure we'll have clients that implement this \"opt into public web hosting\" message, but right now I think we're limited to the command-line interface.",
