Also, if a discussion starts on any of my changes I think it'd be nice to be able to explain why I've made those changes, but I'd like to use a per-edit pseudonym rather than linking my real identity.\r\n\r\nThis feels like the principle of least privilege, maybe it's the *principle of least identity*? It's important to save the provenance of contributions, but maybe it'd be fine to only share partial provenance, sort of how each node in Tor only knows its neighbors but not the entire provenance chain.",
