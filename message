Maybe someone can help?\r\n\r\nI received this text from a friend today:\r\n\r\n> Hey, I had an idea for an essay or a presentation or something. Do you have any idea about the whole stack of translations that happen between the code we write and how it gets interpreted over and over again until it actually gets turned into machine instructions?\r\n> \r\n> Can you point me at some things so I can try to understand that?\r\n\r\nThey've been learning JavaScript recently, specifically React, so it'd be especially nice to find something that isn't just \"here's what a compiler is\". Anything would be rad though!\r\n\r\n#help #programming #learning #software",
