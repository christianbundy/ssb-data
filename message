It's one of my favorite shows, and I could rant about all of the things I love, but two things that bother me are:\r\n\r\n- **Timeline:** The technical details are mostly accurate but *damn* are the timelines off. Maybe I just suck with computers, but I can't imagine writing a useful virus in less than an hour or attack some target that I just learned about. Every time it happens I want someone to say \"yeah sure, give me 9 months\" but it never happens.\r\n- **Symbolism:** I think this was mostly a season 1 thing, but there was lots of \"are you a 1 or a 0\" kind of stuff that made me cringe. Maybe those feelings were intentional?\r\n",
