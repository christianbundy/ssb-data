There's [a bug](https://github.com/fraction/oasis-desktop/issues/3) in Oasis-Desktop that breaks it, sorry for having you download and attempt just to bump into this error! I can ping you once it's fixed, sorry about that.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[@SoapDog](@gaQw6z30GpfsW9k8V5ED4pHrg8zmrqku24zTSAINhRg=.ed25519)\r\n\r\nThe security issue only happens when you're providing an HTTP server on localhost, so Patchfox should be okay. Oops, just saw that this was discussed in a little subthread and you already have this info! I have nothing useful to add, but I still want to send this message because talking with friends is fun!
