I love all the work that's gone into it, but it seems like slashes make URI conformance a problem *and* give the impression that they're filesystem paths. Actually, the \"everything is a file\" thing could be interesting if `cat /http/example.com` actually pulled over HTTP, although I'm not sure how ergonomic it would be.",
