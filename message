I think this was literally discussed [yesterday or the day before](%loflJmtPzAE3k/tofxrhH86+qPxnHaY1bN7Vr+egjzA=.sha256) too.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested, I just put together [a bit of code](https://github.com/fraction/oasis/pull/148) to add a 'Topics' page to Oasis. I haven't really got to use it much yet, but I'm looking forward to seeing this slice of the network more often.",
