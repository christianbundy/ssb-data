The main difference is that Patchwork does `y -> x` and `n -> m` as `{ root: C, fork: A }` just like `m` and `x`. Because of Patchwork's current behavior it would be wise to display `[x, m]` as a thread if they don't have any replies, so I've made the decision to nest `y` and `n` one level deeper than `m` and `x` just to be safe.",
