I'm not sure whether fixing this is within scope (because I've been trying not to inject my own opinions) but maybe?\r\n\r\nI just investigated a bit and I think I found a bug or three on my side. Just pushed a fix. I made a small screen recording of SSB-Keys if you want to check it out: https://asciinema.org/a/KJv84LT2p7ZjIbxkXrGqXmAWk\r\n\r\n(I was going to fix all of the errors, but then I remembered that we're doing [this](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-keys/blob/588846380f0982c01de884b1c2409ee4f3c51ae0/index.js#L73-L75) which I didn't have time to untangle during the recording.)\r\n\r\nThe diff is available here: https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-keys/commit/c53a75b3269264785ad82a46f076e3e4aefe35d3",
