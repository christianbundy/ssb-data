There are a few places where private messages are unacceptable (like `createHistoryStream()`, used for replication) so my preference would be to set `opts = { original: true }` in those few cases, but it'd take a bit of work to refactor everything.\n\nSide-note: I've actually taken a stab at this change in [ssb-db](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-db/commit/0f5dd52517664b9b244075b11488b002bb937e94), but there are other places where we need to set `{ original: true }`:\n\n- Wherever we set the sequence number of each feed, I think it's a vector clock in ssb-db\n- ssb-ooo\n- Probably a bunch of other places",
