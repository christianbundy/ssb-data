Rounds](@0HIFuCSkvQxGssQvk39SPP0RIPHd68nIIlht+nveJ/U=.ed25519)\n\nAfter looking through totalism.org I can't actually find any references to \"hyperspace\" as a `(hacker|maker)space++`, but I could've sworn I'd heard someone else come up with it. Any chance you know?\n\nI'm working to remodel my software business into a cooperative and self-sustaining hackerspace, but:\n\n- \"hackerspace\" implies that there's a physical location\n- \"cyberspace\" implies that it's only online\n- \"hyperspace\" just feels right\n\nI could've sworn I'd found a cyberspace-adjacent definition of hyperspace, but maybe it's all in my head?\n\n[@nanomonkey](@+D0ku/LReK6kqd3PSrcVCfbLYbDtTmS4Bd21rqhpYNA=.ed25519) \n\nYeah, there's a ton of interesting stuff going on (which I have varying opinions about, haha).\n\nI love:\n\n- the graphs (especially on https://totalism.org/stuff)\n- the strong opinions about [non-shitty](https://totalism.org/non-shitty) work\n- the pretty colors\n- the fact that all headers are linkable\n- the huge abundance of links\n- so many photos!\n- I actually love the hue change\n\nI'm not sure that I love:\n\n- lack of visual hierarchy (at least on my screen (?))\n- lots of underlining and unexpected margin/padding on elements\n- I love the verbosity but I wonder whether a pared down version would be less overstimulating\n\nSuch an interesting website, I'm a bit bummed they didn't have the definition I was looking for but I'm really happy I re-found it. Looks like David is [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dcht00), I'm surprised I haven't seen him around Mastodon or SSB.",
