    "text": "[@Tom Coates](@7A2ZxHX+WyIVezulnt0FogzeUVWLq3YHmtX3r7ja4Fw=.ed25519)\n\nI think you're right -- I was thinking about logos like the one [@kas](@RuNxm8SRujPcJx6GjtTQHp6hprAFv5voEkcvoAkB8Pk=.ed25519) linked, which have an icon on the left and a word on the right, but you're right that the icon/symbol isn't \"the logo\" in general.\n\nContext: I've been feeling inspired by [Low-tech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/), which mentioned in [this article](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2018/09/how-to-build-a-lowtech-website.html) that they've replaced their logo with a series of unicode characters:\n\n> ## Default typeface / No logo\n>\n>All resources loaded, including typefaces and logos, are an additional request to the server, requiring storage space and energy use. Therefore, our new website does not load a custom typeface and removes the font-family declaration, meaning that visitors will see the default typeface of their browser. \n>\n>We use a similar approach for the logo. In fact, Low-tech Magazine never had a real logo, just a banner image of a spear held as a low-tech weapon against prevailing high-tech claims.\n>\n>Instead of a designed logotype, which would require the production and distribution of custom typefaces and imagery, Low-tech Magazine’s new identity consists of a single typographic move: to use the left-facing arrow in place of the hypen in the blog’s name: LOW←TECH MAGAZINE.\n\nI thought this was sort of clever, and was wondering why logos have a canonical form as an image rather than a series of unicode characters and an optional font. I'm thinking about this in terms of progressive enhancement, where text-only users might see your logo as \"⚙ Widget Factory\" and everyone else would see it with your custom font.",
