Traditionally all of the SSB interfaces have used the same plugins, which are written in JavaScript and loaded onto the JS-SSB server, but that won't work for other implementations.\r\n\r\nI've been experimenting with how to load these super-useful plugins in the SSB client, without integrating with the server, and I have it working in the JS-SSB implementation, but [the code is still in review](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-db/pull/275). Assuming it keeps working, I'll start using that code in Oasis and anyone that wants to support Oasis just needs to implement this one tiny new method.",
