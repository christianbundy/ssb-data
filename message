I'm excited for this to be accessible for everyone.\n\n---\n\n[@kas](@RuNxm8SRujPcJx6GjtTQHp6hprAFv5voEkcvoAkB8Pk=.ed25519) \n\nI think I'd be comfortable with that while rolling a new client, but currently my focus is supporting feed deletion in the existing clients built on flumedb. I *am* super interested in a sqlite flume view though, which could be super nice, and I'm watching [@piet](@U5GvOKP/YUza9k53DSXxT0mk3PIrnyAmessvNfZl5E0=.ed25519)'s work on [ssb-flumeview-sql](https://github.com/sunrise-choir/ssb-flumeview-sql) with lots of excitement and anticipation.\n\n---\n\n[@DavidW](@PZjQKGbh9KrWHAp1lo9nH/WXqGLp5rpqpVYLccJLkE4=.ed25519) \n\n> as well as a couple who posted hundreds of messages I had to scroll through\n\nHmm, they *should* be hidden by the client immediately after you block them, but I know that some of the existing clients have bugs. For example, I think the `/posts` view in Patchbay shows content from blocked users.\n\n> Might be worth a warning in the ui if it is really long.\n\nDefinitely, I'm wondering whether we should just make it a manual process but give the user the option to do a manual delete after they block a feed.",
