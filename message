There's a [few places from the same owner](http://lightningbarcollectivepdx.com/) and they all have:\r\n\r\n- tons of vegan food options\r\n- good beer, cider, and non-alcoholic drinks\r\n- usually a bunch of TVs for the sports crowd\r\n\r\nA few of them turn into dance clubs at night, which always makes for an really interesting transition.\r\n\r\nOne of them shut down, but the two local dive bars that come to mind are [B Side](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-b-side-tavern-portland), which has a punk vibe, and [Slammer](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/slammer-tavern-portland), which has an... alcohol vibe? Usually they have cheap [light beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_beer), hard liquor, greasy food, graffiti everywhere (especially bathrooms), and an intentional \"our standards are low and that's good\" culture that's confusing but sort of comfortable. As [this sign](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/slammer-tavern-portland?select=y6MlJru33gzh0lpceV4GGw) apparently says:\r\n\r\n> Hot beer  \r\n> Lousy food  \r\n> Bad service\r\n>\r\n> Welcome  \r\n> Have a nice day\r\n\r\nðŸ¤·",
