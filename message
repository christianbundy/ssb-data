I did a *very small* amount of research and couldn't find anything suggesting that it wasn't okay to just re-add tea to it, but unfortunately within a few days of adding tea I noticed a bunch of mold on the top of the brew.\r\n\r\nI read later that I could've scraped the mold off and that I'd probably be fine if it didn't grow back, but I tossed the scoby and the brew and haven't made another batch since.\r\n\r\nIn summary: I have no idea, but *personally* I wouldn't sweat it. With that being said, I have no idea what I'm talking about and I've only made one successful batch of kombucha.",
