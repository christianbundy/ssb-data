I feel similarly about the StandardJS discussion ([ssbc/ssb-server#591](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-server/pull/591)) which seemed to end in the same sort of deadlock.\n\nI'm less focused on the individual problems and more interested in how we can resolve these sorts of problems *in general*. Anyone have thoughts on how this can work better?",
