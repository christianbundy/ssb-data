It's URI-unsafe by default, but there's an IETF standard to fix that (which can be implemented with a quick string substitution). Encoding integers with base32 results in a longer string with URI-safe characters, although it's less common to find in standard libraries (and there's some controversy about The Best Base32, since there are a few).",
