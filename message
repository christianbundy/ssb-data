I wrote an [in-memory flumeview](https://github.com/fraction/flumeview-array/blob/master/index.js) that scaffolds out the basic structure you have to use.\r\n\r\n> so i donâ€™t really need to `view` any kind of state\r\n\r\nWhen you restart the server do you want your view to reprocess all messages? If not, you'd want to make sure you persist your `since` observable so you can tell FlumeDB which message was the last one you've seen.\r\n\r\nMaking it as a Flumeview is great if you like the [Flumeview API](https://github.com/flumedb/flumedb#flumeview-api) and also want your module to be available to other database connections via `flume[viewName]`, but otherwise you can safely just do your own thing.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I only use Flumeviews because lots of modules depend on Secret-Stack-style dependency injection and they want to access the view at `api[viewName]`, but in projects where I don't use Secret-Stack I really don't miss it.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, having multiple dependency systems (Flumeviews, Secret-Stack, Depject, etc) is a pain point for me, so I try to just use the default Node.js dependency system (~CommonJS), but if you enjoy the different trade-offs then you might like Flumeviews for some use-cases.",
