    "text": "Hey [@gozala](@B/Pg4xaGbgy2CFrza9g5kGZurAILCk+NapOcTXah98I=.ed25519)! Things that work for me:\n\n- #fasting ( #intermittent-fasting ) until about noon every day helped me become much more comfortable with being hungry\n- chugging water keeps me full during this time, although a small amount of tea in the morning is cool too\n- one of my goals is to only shop for food at grocery stores rather than restaurants/food carts/minimarts, which ends up being cheaper and usually a hell of a lot more healthy (although I *do* hit up the local burrito cart when I'm feeling extra lazy... or for my birthday)\n- when you're hungry, even simple fruits and vegetables make a great guilt-free snack -- carrots and apples are my personal favorites, and nuts/seeds/etc are fantastic when you're on the go\n\nHope that helps a bit!",
