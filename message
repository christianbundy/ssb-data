I'd merge a patch to add a page like this to Oasis, I think the only big question I have is about the 'mark as read'. We have an [SSB-Unread](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-unread/) plugin, but it persists your read/unread database to your filesystem instead of your log. I think that's because Patchbay automatically marks stuff as you scroll over it, but I'd *personally* be very bummed if I went to a new computer and lost my yes-I-pressed-a-button-because-Ireally-read-this database. What do you think?",
