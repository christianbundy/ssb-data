    "text": "# Protest Trump's Corruption: Today at 5PM (local tz)\n\nRussia interfered with the US presidential election in 2016. An [investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Counsel_investigation_(2017%E2%80%93present)) was started under Rober Mueller, which quickly led straight back to Trump and friends. Jeff Sessions, the Trump crony overseeing the investigation recused himself after being caught meeting secretly with Russian ambassadors, so he had his deputy Rod Rosenstein oversee the investigation instead. Trump, now cornered, has *fired Jeff Sessions* and replaced him with a puppet who recently wrote that [the investigation should be sabotaged](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/11/08/trump-fired-sessions-named-whitaker-stop-mueller-investigation-column/1926460002/):\n\n> I could see a scenario where Jeff Sessions is replaced with a recess appointment, and that attorney general doesn't fire Bob Mueller, but he just reduces his budget to so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt.\n\n**TL;DR:** Trump is so afraid of being prosecuted that he's fired the prosecutor's boss and replaced him with a Trump loyalist.\n\nThe thing is, [we've prepared for this](https://act.moveon.org/event/mueller-firing-rapid-response-events/search/), and protests have been triggered at hundreds of pre-planned locations all over the country. Similar to [electoral politics](%oZhrO7tLlbqVKVjaVcBVKbdqT69j0qT/JQEDVpJlu70=.sha256), I'm really not into milquetoast protesting or begging \"the authorities\" to oversee other \"authorities\", but things aren't getting better and I'm running out of options.\n\n**I'll be out protesting tonight, and I hope some other folks in the US will join me.**",
