    "text": "This is part of a train of thought I've had for the past few months about asking people to do things that are hard. People rarely do things that are hard, and when we commit to hard things we usually fail. Maybe instead the more powerful thing would be **encouraging things that are easy**.\r\n\r\nI think about this a lot in the context of consumer habits, which *I know* aren't the main driver of many problems, but they're a starting place for people to start experimenting with personal activism. Anyway, my point that \"choose X when it's easy for you\" seems way more effective than \"choose X no matter what or you become impure\". In the context of diet, I'd rather see 1000 people doing an easy 'meatless Monday' instead of 10 people trying really hard to avoid all animal products.",
