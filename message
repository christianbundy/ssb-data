I think the open issues are a great place to start, and SSB-Keys could definitely use some love: https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-keys/issues\r\n\r\n(There don't seem to be any contribution guides in that project (!), but if you make a fork of the project and make a pull request I'd love to take a look at it. Please @mention me directly!)\r\n\r\nIf you don't see any easy footholds that look like work you'd like to tackle, I'd love to pair with you (maybe next week) and work through one of these together.",
