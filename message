They look a bit under-done and the texture is a tiny bit more crumbly than I'd like, but my preference is super gooery cookies. I'll probably experiment with different amounts of salt and baking soda in the future. I remember I saw a guide a while ago that helped troubleshoot ratio problems based on the features of the cookie.",
