It worked!\r\n\r\nBasically I've used an `<iframe>` that points a page called `/messages` which streams the messages over HTTP as they're published. Instead of doing the JavaScript thing where we poll the API every second, we just have a never-ending HTTP response that we can embed in the page.\r\n\r\nYou can see the [crappy source code](https://github.com/christianbundy/html-chat), but I'll keep up a [crappy web demo](http://35.223.151.20:3301/) for a few hours if anyone wants to play with it. You can stream the `<iframe>` source [here](http://35.223.151.20:3301/messages) to see what's happening behind the scenes. Please note that this has very little security (just a CSP), and messages can be written by anyone with the URL, so please consider whether your security model allows you to use random prototype chat software where anyone can publish messages.\r\n\r\nP.S. I used [Filigree](https://cinnamon-bun.github.io/filigree-website/) and it was very fun. Highly recommend.\r\n\r\n#hacks #filigree",
