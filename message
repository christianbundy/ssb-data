I think it's important to remember that Pull-Stream is a framework *on top* of JavaScript, which increases the number of things that beginners have to learn. I like Pull-Stream, but I'd like for it to be optional.\r\n\r\nOnce [this pull request](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-client/pull/52) is merged I'd like to make a change so that if you call a sync or async method without a callback, then it should return a promise by default. So we could have both:\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nssb.whoami((err, val) => {\r\n  console.log(val.id)\r\n})\r\n\r\n// and\r\n\r\nconst { id } = await ssb.whoami()\r\nconsole.log(id)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd like to do the same with streams, but I haven't given it enough thought. Is it possible for a stream to tell whether it's being consumed via Pull-Stream or async-iterables? It's easy to tell whether or not you have a callback, but I haven't thought about how to do the same with streams.",
