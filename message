Future-me should be happy to read this once future-me forgets how we evolved. It’s massive for a blog post, just under 30 minutes, but that’s the best I could do, condensing 9 hours worth of material.\n\nI started on this article this morning and have been working through it very slowly, reading a few paragraphs every few hours when I remember the tab is open. It's been super interesting so far, but this quote (from Sapiens?) has stuck out to me:\n\n> One of history’s few iron laws is that luxuries tend to become necessities and spawn new obligations\n",
