It'd be weird if images or videos had their own programming languages that could get stuck in infinite loops, and I like the idea of avoiding JS whenever it's convenient.\r\n\r\nI don't really have strong feelings on it, but I'd love to hear if you do! Do you have thoughts / feels about browser JS stuff?",
