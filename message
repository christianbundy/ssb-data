Sometimes happens IRL, imagine like 8 people sitting in a circle. :)\r\n- **p2p:** peer-to-peer, usually in the context of computer networking, where you try to emphasize direct connections between people instead of depending on intermediaries like Google or Facebook or Twitter. Also used in an economic context, but that's a bit squishier to me than the computer context (probably because I'm not an economist).\r\n- **Git:** software for keeping track of changes in documents and code in a collaborative fashion without having to use products like Google Docs.l\r\n- **decentralized:** the process of reducing concentrations of power and removing intermediaries that separate us from the people and things we want to connect with\r\n- **Dat:** a technology like SSB that (as I understand) has received lots more funding and is generally considered easier to develop software with than SSB. They have a social network, https://unwalled.garden/, that I've not heard much about, but is being worked on by Paul Frazee who used to do SSB stuff.\r\n\r\nIt would be cool to have some sort of #ssb-wiki where we could define all this jargon and maybe build some #collective-intelligence around the way we communicate on the network. #somebody-should",
