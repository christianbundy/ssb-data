In my mind it seems obvious that we probably shouldn't be using non-strict mode in JavaScript, there aren't any obvious collections of features that we should prune from HTML or CSS.\n\nFor example, I've been using flexbox because it makes layouts ultra-simple in Chromium/Firefox/etc, but it doesn't look like there's any support for that in IE/Dillo/lynx/etc. This means that you have to choose between compatibility and ergonomics, which is a zero-sum trade-off that nobody really wants to make.",
