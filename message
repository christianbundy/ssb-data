But if you have to leave the house at all then it seems like we should just try to avoid it so that we can slow the spread as much as possible.\r\n\r\nI'd imagine that this is something that others have thought about, if you read any interesting takes on coronavirus accelerationism I'd be really interested to hear from people who know this stuff well. \r\n\r\n> So if you’re below 50, its not an issue.\r\n\r\nSmol note: Lots of people under 50 can have temporary or chronic health problems that would make it harder to fight an infection.\r\n\r\n",
