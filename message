    "text": "After playing with this a bit more, I'm under the impression that the obv library only returns a function when a listener is added *before* `set()` is called. I'm not sure why, but the solution seems to be:\n\n```js\nconst Obv = require('obv')\nconst since = Obv()\n\nlet rm = since(() => {\n  rm()\n})\n\nsince.set(-1)\n```\n\nUnfortunately, I'm unclear on how (and why) this should be done in a flumeview. I've tried looking into other views, but I'm having trouble grokking why they don't have the same problem."
