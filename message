Watch the video and listen to him laugh at \"AIDS\", insults about \"hobos\", and ask \"is that a racist thing\" when he doesn't understand a joke **because he knows exactly who he's talking to**. If someone shows you who they are, believe them.\r\n\r\n> I have no real idea what Charlottesville is\r\n\r\nThis conversation started with me linking you to the Wikipedia article about it, please at least skim. If you don't want to read, at least look at the photo.\r\n\r\n> <screetch>?\r\n\r\nI don't get it, can you explain this joke to me?",
