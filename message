Last week there was a big upgrade, so hopefully some of the changes will resolve the issues you're seeing.\n\nThe \"Attach file\" is using the paperclip emoji, so you'll need a font with emoji support installed on your system. I was able to use `pacman -S noto-fonts-emoji` to fix the issue locally, but you may have another font you prefer. I've opened [a thread](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1798360) to see how to package (or recommend) emojis better in `ssb-patchwork`.\n\nI'm not an expert with Scuttlebutt, but I'd be happy to work with you to resolve any issues you're having with the AUR package!",
