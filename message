Some random quotes, translated to copyleft:\r\n\r\n> It’s one thing to be provocative but another to alienate those you’re trying to reach.\r\n\r\n>  Try not to make your ~~vegan~~ copyleft advocacy a monologue—and especially not a rant. [...]  it’s understandable to want to browbeat people into ~~going vegan~~ using copyleft -- to force them to share our sense of horror and outrage. This is not the most effective way to convince people to change their behavior, though.\r\n\r\n> The number one thing that we do wrong is that we place personal purity ahead of pragmatism. We lose sight of the fact that ~~veganism~~ copyleft is not an end in and of itself but rather a means of ending ~~cruelty to animals~~ private enclosure of the commons. ~~Being vegan~~ Using copyleft is not about being perfect and being responsible for no cruelty at all -- it’s about decreasing ~~suffering~~ exploitation as much as possible.\r\n\r\n> If you’re at a holiday party with ~~meat-eaters~~ permissive licensors  and you’re talking about how you can’t ~~eat the bread~~ run some code because you don’t know what’s in it, or you’re at a ~~restaurant~~ conference and there’s ~~a veggie burger on the menu~~ some software on GitHub but you give the server the third degree about the ingredients or about how it’s ~~cooked~~ licensed, you are forgetting the essence of ~~being vegan~~ using copyleft. Sure, the ~~animal-derived products in that veggie burger~~ permissively licensed may be gross, and you should politely do what you’re most comfortable doing, but please think about the message that you’re sending to others at the ~~table~~ conference who might have otherwise considered the ~~plight of animals~~ copyleft but now likely think that ~~following a vegan diet~~ using copyleft is difficult.\r\n\r\nOkay it went a little off the rails at the end but YOU GET WHAT I MEAN. It's a bummer that we have so many smart and thoughtful people who want to improve the world but we end up alienating people because we can't advocate for [insert topic here] effectively.\r\n\r\nAnyway, [here's Wonderwall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQfpO49BMHo).",
