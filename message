Instead of conspiring over a medium that can be read by security guards, I wonder whether fictional short stories might give you the ability to share ideas with contacts without actively conspiring.\n\nFor example, in an environment where saying \"you should unionize your workplace\" incurs harsh penalties, you might be better off with a short story describing how workers in the dystopian future of 2118 were able to unionize their mining colony. Maybe the \"all persons ficticious\" disclaimer may be of use:\n\n> The story, all names, characters, and incidents portrayed in this production are fictitious. No identification with actual persons (living or deceased), places, buildings, and products is intended or should be inferred. \n\nGiven that posts on here are semi-permanent I doubt many of us will be advocating for criminal conspiracy, but it seems like you may be able to provide words of solidarity and examples of ficticious bravery without creating a risky environment for yourself, your friends, or anyone incarcerated. I imagine #zines could be a reasonably effective medium.",
