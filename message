It was uplifting to meet other rad folks focused on improving the world but there was also a heightened sense of the problems we're facing (and the feedback loops that are making them worse). Everyone is working *really hard* and we're using all of the resources we have available, but I'm feeling the need for a more cohesive and well-articulated vision of what we want the future to look like.\n\n**Has anyone shared a theory of change that we can discuss and iterate on?** It feels to me that we're all working on improved alternatives to conventional systems (technology, agriculture, energy, housing, culture, etc) but I'm concerned that I don't have a framework for what we want / expect the world to look like in 10, 20, or 40 years.",
