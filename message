Super curious to hear your thoughts.\r\n\r\n> it feels really approachable without knowing so much about the internals of SSB or the rabbit hole of dependencies in the server\r\n\r\nWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. If you notice anything that doesn't feel approachable, That's A Bug, and I'd love to fix it with you. As someone taking a look at the project for the first time you have the most valuable perspective, and I'd love your help fixing pain points when you find them. I promise you won't hurt my feelings. :)",
