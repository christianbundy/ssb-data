The big downside is that it adds complexity for static analysis, so it's easy to parse `require('foo')` and be sure that we're using that dependency but harder to see that from `const x = 'foo'; require(x)`.\r\n\r\nFlotilla *should* be using [Common-Good](https://github.com/christianbundy/common-good), which bundles [Dependency-Check](https://github.com/dependency-check-team/dependency-check), but it looks like it's missing (like the readme ðŸ˜‰).",
