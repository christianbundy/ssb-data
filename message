If we drop network compatibility, then two apps can bridge their networks through the signing protocol *or* the database protocol. For example, [@Daan](@MRiJ+CvDnD9ZjqunY1oy6tsk0IdbMDC4Q3tTC8riS3s=.ed25519) wrote [a few lines of Python](%+mAKpB87oaT18XaHtW+0Mg6/gPEtoM0y9XGz64h4E7Q=.sha256) and was able to bridge FlumeDB into a prototype of a new network protocol.\r\n\r\nI think we can replicate messages and ensure community continuity without making everyone run the exact same code. As long as we can build bridges, between database and network protocols, I think we have lots of great options that haven't been explored yet.",
