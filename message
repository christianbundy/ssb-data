I'd never used Redux before, and after using it with you I got to spend some time reading Redux docs which informed my SSB indexing experiments. Plus the CSS changes and username change were SO SNAZZY. I'm super happy with how it turned out. I didn't need an HTML-only chat in the first place. :~)",
