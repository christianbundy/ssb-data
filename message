If you're using SSB-Server v16.0.0 (released May 27) or SSB-DB v20.0.0 (released May 21) you should upgrade immediately to the patched versions.\r\n\r\nThe `get()` method had a bug where it attempted to decrypt every message that it could. If you have private messages and are using a plugin like SSB-OOO then a network peer could ask you for a message and your computer would give them the *decrypted* message. **There is no evidence that other SSB apps are vulnerable or that this problem has been exploited in the wild.**\r\n\r\nMore info here: https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-db/security/advisories/GHSA-mpgr-2cx9-327h\r\n\r\n#ssb-db #ssb-server #security",
