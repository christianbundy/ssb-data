My concern was mostly a brown liquid with green mold that was all over the bottom of the unit and growing into the filters. I got *most* of it out, but it still doesn't smell right. I suppose maybe I could sculpt some polystyrene to replace the moldy insulation, and there's probably *something* I could do to fix the rust...\n\nI found the product manual online and it looks like this has an energy efficiency ratio of 9.2, whereas another one I'm looking at is around 12. Only about 30% more efficient, which is sort of surprising for products manufactured 26 years apart.",
