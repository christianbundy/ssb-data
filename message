It's not great, but I think there are lots of use-cases where the simplicity and developer ergonomics might be more useful than the transport encryption. \r\n\r\nPrivate messages, of course, would continue to be encrypted, and we'd have the option of adding TLS or SHS/etc, but for a 'minimal SSB implementation' that's a problem I'm kicking down the road a bit.",
