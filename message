    "text": "Man, I really need to do a crash course with Mutant. Are there any recommended guides, or is it just something you need to dive into? I think learning Mutant and depject at the same time may be counter-productive.\n\nI think this was the code I was looking for:\n\n```\nif (!isObservable(obs)) return obs ? ifTrue : ifFalse // +++\n```\n\nI'm planning to try to identify (and *hopefully* remove) all of the unnecessary Mutant boilerplate in Patchbay. I'm not sure how much there is, but I imagine it'll make our errors a bit more manageable if we can remove code that's effectively unusee. I'm thinking something like this will work:\n\n```\nif (!isObservable(obs)) {\n  console.trace('Non-observable passed to when()')\n  return obs ? ifTrue : ifFalse\n}\n```\n\n\n(100% just your code plus `console.trace()`)"
