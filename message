It gives a great impression of how pieces fit together, what to expect when looking at plans, and some great guidelines that I imagine make it much easier to interface together. I'm noticing how much I really appreciate all of the work that goes into well-defined interfaces.\n\nBacklink: %oACqMTQuj8YXx0vylUNQB8lLlSGM7iK28Qcv5vCdmoA=.sha256",
