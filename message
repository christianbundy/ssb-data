Parties to the conversation must operate at a meta-level, and not misperceive criticism as insults.\r\n\r\nI feel an obligation to highlight that for me, SSB feels like a neighborhood park where everyone gets together to talk about the things and people they care about. I don't think there's any obligation to \"operate at a meta-level\", but if someone has agreed to that rule please let me know.\r\n\r\nTo be candid, it feels like we're all hanging out at a picnic table and you're dragging around a podium and challenging people to formal debates.\r\n\r\nI understand that there's enormous value in finding consensus, and each community has different goals, but for me the point of SSB is **building social fabric**. I appreciate the amount of thought you put into problems and I'd like to continue hearing what you have to say, but I've noticed that you're a bit sharp with anyone you disagree with.\r\n\r\n> And you want me to be constructive and non-insulting, when faced with such a prospect?\r\n\r\n**TL;DR:** Yes, \"constructive and non-insulting\" are the absolute minimum I'd expect of someone having a friendly conversation. I know you can do it, and I hope you choose to.",
