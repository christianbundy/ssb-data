I've seen mentions of the PNW on there, but the only people I know for sure are local:\n\n- https://social.coop/@christianbundy: me :~)\n- https://social.coop/@jordancrane: one of my close friends, also a co-op friendly tech worker\n- https://social.coop/@rbenjamin: just met him last week, not a tech worker but _very_ knowledgeable about co-ops\n\nWe all grabbed a pint last week and talked about starting a small [co-op investment club](http://thecp.coop/), basically just trying to put a few bucks a month into in co-ops rather than banking on the success of Wall Street, but I think the most important thing is just finding like-minded people, meeting up semi-regularly, and letting cooperation take its course.\n\nI started a small (i.e. just me) LLC a few years ago that keeps me busy 9-5, but working alone seems inefficient and isn't my ideal. Most of my work is sysadmin stuff, devops, and plain old programming, but most of my clients are run-of-the-mill corporations which makes it _feel_ like a traditional 9-5 sometimes. \n\nWhat are you up to? I'm down in #pdx, by the way -- I imagine you're up in SW Washington?\n\n---\n\nNot sure if this will encrypt properly unless I @ you, so: [@ike](@+aQL1YGSyeEIhPRMcw96/ztOy41RoKSGD7la7BUZVmA=.ed25519).",
