I've been interested in decentralized decision making systems for years but somehow having the basics explained was really impactful. I see a whole page on [Teal organizations](http://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Teal_Organizations), is that relevant to how things run on SSB or more of an aside?\n\nI know you've got all sorts of good links stashed away, so if there's anything else you think I might like reading I'd love to check them out. :heart:",
