    "text": "There are always crows that I pass on my walk to my office in the morning, so after reading this post I decided to stuff a bunch of seeds in my pocket so I could make some friends. Turns out that Wednesday is their \"flying around in the air just above me\" day, so I wasn't able to find anyone that I could share with. I tossed a few seeds on the ground just in case, but I'm hoping I'll see a few of them walking around on the sidewalk on my way home."
