I've been thinking lots about dependency management for the past few days and while **it's a super hard problem** it's surprising how many problems we inherit from the existing solutions.\r\n\r\n(FWIW, while working on my hack of a Git-based package manager I realized that Windows doesn't support 'simple' stuff like Unix-style symlinks. Software is hard.)\r\n\r\nTHINKPAD WHEN?!?!",
