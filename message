I tried using their website, which looks sweet, but I don't think it's compatible with their [deprecated] open source implementation.\r\n\r\nWhat's everyone using these days instead of GitBook? I want to build a small [wiki-like system](%GSPiY4r3PgcBBwvPRUpDAbOORmlwkJehzeRPsWpToHc=.sha256) and was planning to use GitBook, but it's important to me that it's open source. Any ideas?\r\n\r\n#gitbook #wiki",
