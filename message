You're really great at explaining things, and I'm great at not knowing how things work (especially in Rust!), and I'd imagine that future SSB + Rust developers might hit the same snags that you do.\r\n\r\nI'm sure I'll regret this sentence, but: building a small parser in Rust sounds fun! Plus since you have a good-enough implementation, it sounds like it's something I could tinker on for a while without any rush. Maybe I could talk [@sean](@N/vWpVVdD1e8IbACUQE4EVGL6+aodQfbQZ8ByC+k79s=.ed25519) into helping me suck less at Rust while I'm at it.",
