Issue about it is [here](https://github.com/fraction/oasis/issues/208).\r\n\r\n> But Iâ€™m having real trouble running either sbot or sbotc against oasis. is that expected?\r\n\r\nIt's not expected. I've had it happen when it says \"can't connect to server\" or whatever, but I've never had that problem with SSB-CLI. I wish I knew what the problem was. ðŸ¤”\r\n\r\n> Btw it would be really cool if there were an oasis page thatâ€™s just a textfield where I could insert arbitrary json, and if itâ€™s valid it gets posted.\r\n\r\nThat'd be really cool. I've also been considering just embedding SSB-CLI so that you can run *any* MuxRPC command, because why not?",
