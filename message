On the other hand, it's a common language for beginners, so if you want a really low barrier to entry it's not a bad choice.\r\n\r\nI think the *really* important think is declaring that you're going to use a subset of the language, like [English for specific purposes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_for_specific_purposes), and choosing what that subset is. IMO there's nothing wrong with:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst list = [1, 2, 3]\r\nconst result = list\r\n  .map((item) => item + 1)\r\n  .filter((item) => item > 2)\r\nconsole.log(result) // => [3, 4]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this way lies madness:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconsole.log((function (y) {\r\n  var x = [], i, j\r\n  for (i = 1; i < 5; i++) {\r\n    x.push(i)\r\n    for (j = 0; j < i; ++j) {\r\n      if (j < 2) {\r\n        delete x[j]\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  j = []\r\n  for (i = 0; i < 10; i ++) {\r\n    if (!!!!x[i]) j.push(x[i])\r\n  }\r\n  return j\r\n})(42))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs long as you've got a linter and a few senior people on the team I think you can usually turn the latter into a learning experience, which is awesome, but the language *does* lend itself to abuse and jank unless you're very careful.",
