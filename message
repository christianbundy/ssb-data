On one hand I love how synthetics resist water and insulate when wet, but they also seem to require large supply chains and heaps of petroleum.\n\n---\n\n\n[@Alexandra](@uNnmfi94AUaaUOJ4ETttjGcP0/vBY7NRhXHMHwHkv3Q=.ed25519)\n\n\nWould it be possible to resolve the sitting-standing issue by changing how high I wear my pants, or is that just a thing that happens regardless? I think [Kuhl](https://www.kuhl.com/kuhl/mens/pants/) does nice articulated knees, but I don't know how excited I am by the rest of the pants. I don't know why I'm so particular! \n\n\n> Are you thinking of a way to contact the company like \"I have to replace the left back of my pants, size 14\" and they'd send you a pattern piece?\n\nBackstory: one of my belt loops started falling apart at the seam, and while this *particular* problem would be easy to solve I realized that if I damaged my belt loop my only option would be to find some similar-enough nylon and sew it on. The pants I bought use some proprietary fabric and I can't find a color match from the local fabric store, which made me think \"I would totally pay $10 for a pre-cut belt loop with the correct fabric\". I totally agree that many pants would be a total pain to repair, but maybe if they were intended to be repaired that wouldn't be a problem? I'm being optimistic here.\n\n---\n\n[@gustavo](@43oScJQ2UAivj6Frzp6ydgWPgmmw8ZOjKw7wsCtIe54=.ed25519) \n\nThis may just be a social conditioning thing, but I've always viewed kilts a bit like [five finger shoes](https://us.vibram.com/shop/fivefingers/) -- I'll have to try one on sometime! In high school one of the teachers wore a utilikilt every day, and he seemed to love it.\n\n---\n\n[@nanomonkey](@+D0ku/LReK6kqd3PSrcVCfbLYbDtTmS4Bd21rqhpYNA=.ed25519) \n\nI've got a sewing machine but only a few items of each sort of clothing, so I'm always hesitant to get *too* experimental. I should probably just pick up some stuff from a thrift store and practice a bit, or maybe just try to construct something myself? My goal is to have a wardrobe that works both in the city and the wilderness, so I'm currently benefitting from the \"tapered pants\" fashion (so they don't snag on branches), but I suppose we'll see what happens when that's no longer in fashion!\n\nI asked Dominic above, but do you mostly use cotton pants as well? I like the idea of a nylon-cotton blend, but living in Portland even my nylon pants get soaked every few days. I've considered lightly waxed cotton pants but those sound sticky, but I remember reading something about a super tight weave of cotton that was waterproof because it was too tight to absorb any water. Just looked it up and it's called [ventile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventile). I wonder whether you could do the same thing with something like hemp?\n\n---\n\n[@ansuz](@ppdSxn1pSozJIqtDE4pYgwaQGmswCT9y15VJJcXRntI=.ed25519) \n\nThat's really cool! I've never spent any time knitting but it's always seemed fun, I'll follow along with that project.\n\n---\n\n[@John Colagioia](@RoHPOaN65z8ZVYwPr19Ni4KgYCE05k+FAKMdDPyHbvs=.ed25519) \n\nInteresting, does it just output the measurements at the end? I tried to test it out but it insisted that I create an account.\n\n---\n\n[@enkiv2](@Q6jeOaoJOdFq8/3oFaOYC6bKhaVCD3IIdpjG+7Fab2M=.ed25519) \n\nRoger that! I've never worn BDU pants but I've used a hip strap tightener before and it works great. I don't exactly understand *why* it's so much more comfortable, but it is. Maybe it's because you have the same amount of bunching but it's split into two places, which makes it seem smaller?\n\n---\n\n[@Wiremonk](@Lzi397mUhIVf3nm2p55EJtiCExpcHO6D6NF0pS1VaR8=.ed25519) \n\nYou'd think I'd know to do that after talking about [\"human-meaningful information at the beginning\"](%aUHk2iZgb7QPZVP5EWyJhW7EsZzgvlx3/VCrCOQYSZ0=.sha256). Thanks!\n\n---\n\n[@af](@UYyBSgcbRAlNxWZkuU0oCYLo2s2cV3yh4FDUv/OxVwQ=.ed25519) \n\nYeah, I'll often buy online because all of the places near me tend to sell fashion pieces or outdoor gear, but I haven't found any that make outdoor gear that can be worn [comfortably] in a \"business casual\" environment. I like [Outlier](https://shop.outlier.nyc/shop/retail/pants/) but they're hard to repair because they use proprietary fabrics. \n\nAdmittedly I'm less focused on fashion (as long as it isn't actively unfashionable), so my goal is to wear pants that are loose enough that I have a full range of motion but tight enough that they don't get snagged on brush when I'm off-tail. I'm no fun, I know! ðŸ˜‰\n\nRegarding the belt: same, my current problem is that my pants stretch out over time, so straight out of the dryer they're too tight and after a few days they're too loose. I have a nylon belt that I use outdoors and a synthetic leather belt I use the rest of the time but I'd rather just use it for funerals and such.",
