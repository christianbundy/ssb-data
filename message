We *could* use the `branch` property to pull threads together but I don't think it's well-specified and it's super hacky. I think the reality is that the number of topics `<=` the number of messages.\r\n\r\nHere's what the spec looks like in my brain:\r\n\r\n- New topic\r\n  - no `root`\r\n  - no `fork`\r\n- Reply to topic\r\n  - `root` = key of topic message\r\n  - should appear as sibling to other replies to topic\r\n  - should appear as descendant of topic\r\n- Reply to reply (sub-topic)\r\n  - `root` = key of reply \r\n  - `fork` = `root` of reply\r\n  - should appear as sibling to other replies to this reply\r\n    - i.e. only 1 sub-topic per message, so the number of topics is <= the number of messages\r\n  - should appear as descendant of message\r\n  - should appear as deep descendant of message's topic\r\n\r\nSome UI thoughts:\r\n\r\n- messages probably shouldn't have \"thread reply\" buttons, the thread reply should probably just exist at the bottom of the thread\r\n- if a message already has sub-topic replies, you probably shouldn't be nudged toward a message reply until you've seen the thread already (maybe the discussion is already active)\r\n\r\n> you CANNOT do this (two different nested reply conversations starting off of C):\r\n\r\nI think you can, but it requires that `n` and `y` are *message replies* to `m` and `x` respectively. I think this might actually be a good thing for discussion cohesion, as it takes 2 message replies to actually break off from the original post.\r\n\r\n`</brain-dump>`",
