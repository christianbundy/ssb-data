The simplest thing I can think of is to make a list of SSB modules that are widely used and then asking developers if there's one that they want to offer to maintain for a period. Big variables:\r\n\r\n- How much money do we offer for this? My gut is like $60/mo, which isn't much, but we also don't have a ton.  If Patchwork supported 6 modules then we'd only have 13 months until we run out of cash. Maybe that's okay?\r\n- How long should the periods be? My gut is like ~3 months.\r\n- How many modules do we try to support? I'm imagining that we can make a dependency graph and then prioritize the modules that are most used and have the least coverage by other maintainers.",
