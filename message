Is there an easy way to do this with npm?\r\n\r\nI think I'd like something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install --platform=darwin\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I can't figure it out. It seems like `node-gyp` or `node-gyp-build` or `prebuild` might give me a way to do this, but I can't figure it out.\r\n\r\nHere's my best attempt: https://github.com/fraction/oasis/pull/251\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it just packages `node` and `npm` for a given platform, which means that they have to unzip the archive and run a script that runs `npm install` for them with the bundles binaries, but that's less than ideal. It also means that I have to ship `npm`, which I'd really prefer to avoid if possible.\r\n\r\n#node #nodejs #npm #dev",
