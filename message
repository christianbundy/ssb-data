I put together a small SSB validator in two hours that passes the same tests as [this branch of SSB-Validate](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-validate/pull/21), but those tests don't seem to cover `previous` or `sequence`, which makes me suspicious that there's lots of other untested behavior.\r\n\r\nI was originally trying to use the [legacy-value-testdata](https://github.com/sunrise-choir/legacy-value-testdata) repository, but there's lots of 'valid' data like [this](https://github.com/sunrise-choir/legacy-value-testdata/blob/master/yay/0225662813ad4a08490d828cec9f0abfc929df5e) which suggests that it's more focused on the encoding rather than the semantics.\r\n\r\n#ssb-dev #help",
