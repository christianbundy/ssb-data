I copied logit and published a *smol* branch with JSON in the commit messages [here](%fn7fVTN5P+ZEl4/pa1IylPrww4bK4JqIaJ5YalLXCjk=.sha256), but I'm a bit bummed that we have duplicate fields:\r\n\r\n- commit ID == message key\r\n- parent == previous\r\n- author == author + timestamp\r\n- signature == gpgsig\r\n- git has committer\r\n- ssb has sequence number and hash algorithm\r\n\r\nIf we had a git [feed type](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-keys/pull/61) we could probably reuse these fields, it feels a bit backward since I imagine they don't compress well? Especially since the SSB ecosystem seems to be moving toward CBOR / etc.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'd love to think and talk more about it, this is fun!",
