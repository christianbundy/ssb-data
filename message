    "text": "Weird problem, help.\n\nMy phone (Pixel XL) has decided that it won't charge when it's turned on, and the only way to charge it is to turn it off and connect a slow charger. After charging slowly for a few minutes I can switch to a faster charger, but it's a total pain and I don't understand why it's happening. When the phone is on I can't use *any* charger, and when the phone is turned off I *have* to start with a slow charger (USB from my laptop) for a minute before switching to a fast charger.\n\nAnyone know what might cause this, or have suggestions on how to fix this?",
