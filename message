    "text": "# I lost a podcast. Have you seen it?\n\nI remember stumbling upon a podcast a while ago but I can't find it. I only remember one episode and the website it was on.\n\n## Episode\n\nUnfortunately I only remember one episode: I was researching something, I think one of these:\n\n- ketogenic diet ( #keto )\n- intermittent fasting ( #intermittent-fasting )\n- plant-based diet ( #plant-based )\n \nThey had a doctor on the podcast, I think she was a neurologist or something neurologist-adjacent, and she was explaining the effects of one of the above. IIRC she was saying why it was unhealthy, but was going into excruciating detail (in a good way) about exactly why she recommended against it. I remember being surprised, since most of the \"arguments\" for different diets rarely goes deeper than a Joe Rogan episode, but she seemed to really know what she was talking about. I think they mentioned ayahuasca somewhere on the episode as well? Or maybe that was another episode?\n\n## Website\n\nThe website had earthy tones and IIRC the sidebar was on the right. The episode page I was on had a brief description of the episode and an inline link to listen to the episode. I keep thinking the name of the podcast was \"Primitive Technology\" but I know that's something else. Primal something? I'm not sure, maybe it rings a bell for someone else.\n\nIIRC they had all sorts of interesting episodes on #solarpunk -ish topics, mostly science-based lifestyle stuff like diet, sleep, drugs, community, and I *think* some village building stuff? It's hard to figure out what's real and which details I'm making up as I go along. Brains are funny.\n\nI think there were a few hundred episodes, each 1-2 hours long, and after skimming a few I thought \"damn I'd love to listen to *all* of these\", but then I promptly forgot it. Any chance one of you knows what I'm talking about? ðŸ¤ž",
