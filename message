I think the main problem is that all of the plugins treat the config as a static thing, so they only check it when they're initialized (and aren't expecting it to change), but maybe we could just restart the server with your preferred network? Might be fun to try and implement in Oasis once I'm done with multiple identities.\r\n\r\nAnd that prompt looks great, when I'm done with my Fish experiment (soon!) I'll probably go home to Zsh. I'll be sure to try it out, thanks for the tip!",
