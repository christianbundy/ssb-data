I used [this recipe](https://zerowastechef.com/2020/02/19/vegan-sourdough-pancakes/) and made two pancakges with about 3/4 cup of starter. I didn't have any almond flour so I just sprinkled in a bit of sugar instead. I also tossed in some blueberries, which complemented the tangy flavor.\r\n\r\n![Photo of a lightly toasted sourdough starter pancake with blueberries on a black plate](&G/iCA84+ZSDOmIgZO0AY28i4Dx5Un47Az/FC9V+An3E=.sha256)\r\n\r\nTo be honest I was a bit skeptical of these before I tried them, because my starter smells mostly like farts, but this ended up being really tasty and I'm excited to try it again.",
