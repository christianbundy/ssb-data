I think it's interesting that SHS keeps randos from discovering your pubkey but also it means we have to broadcast our pubkey instead so I don't think most of us use that security property. ðŸ¤· I'm curious what SSB would look like if we just took the 'boring technology' approach of HTTP + TLS + JSON-RPC instead of Multiserver + SHS + Box-Stream + MuxRPC + etc.",
