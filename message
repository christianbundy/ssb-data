    "text": "Thanks [@nanomonkey](@+D0ku/LReK6kqd3PSrcVCfbLYbDtTmS4Bd21rqhpYNA=.ed25519) and [@misty](@pywb9JjJUwlMJBb33nc5fOCACbH6gN1U6O39E7uqrv8=.ed25519), I appreciate you both taking the time to reply and give some words of advice. \n\n> I found out that I was testifying when I came home and there were 15 of the guy's friends in front of my house with my testimony in their hands looking to intimidate me.\n\nMan, that's rough. I feel for you, and it's frustrating that the testimony was even a part of their intimidation. I'm not expecting to get hassled (is anyone?), but it's frustrating that witness testimony can leak to the suspect before the court date.\n\nMy only previous testimony was the 911 call, which I don't remember too well, so I suppose I'll just show up and see what I'm asked, if anything.\n\n> Our justice system is very broken. I'm speaking from the vantage point of someone who has dealt with various levels of domestic violence in the past.\n\nThis all seems like great advice and I'll likely re-read this again before the court date. Thank you. I'm upset that domestic violence can occur so close to home but it feels *so far away* and super isolating. I felt a responsibility to help, but felt a bit useless having to call the police just to help my neighbor get back inside. I suppose I'll just show up and give my testiomony in the hopes that it can help my neighbor.\n\nI wish I would've known you back when this happened! She moved out a few weeks after this happened, but I remember feeling a strong urge to reach out and let her know that she had our support if she wanted it. Is there anything useful that I could've done, or is that energy best channeled into support for groups who support survivors of domestic violence?\n\n> If you ever want to hear about a time where I was intimated by a non-attorney into answering questions AND showing up for a legal matter in which I was provided literally very vague information -- and how I handled it -- it's a good one. \n\nI'd love to hear about this, have you posted the story before?",
