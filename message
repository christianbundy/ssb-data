I saw [@mikey](@6ilZq3kN0F+dXFHAPjAwMm87JEb/VdB+LC9eIMW3sa0=.ed25519)'s post about Grid Beam and decided to give it a shot. This is *very much* a work in progress, but I guess I'm using it \"in production\" because it's what I'm using to... produce things? I don't know. Photos!\r\n\r\n![Photo of jankdesk, a rectangular prism made of 2x2 with a think sheet of thin particle board on top.](&D7AzC6itV6NR3NTwD50JAWmpW0bXMjtRy2q0GaEPIaM=.sha256)\r\n\r\n![Jankdesk on its side, showing toggle bolts and terribly drilled holes.](&JF5yxo7y0PxnsAFjJOVxSKJLZ6WZEI3L4e3uGtgmF2c=.sha256)\r\n\r\n![Jankdesk with a monitor, keyboard, and a mouse.](&0rLwjjiHdNYnl7N38uc0bFP5a5JC4HjP9LW5TUTMx9c=.sha256)\r\n\r\nI ran out of wood so it ended up having 1 foot of depth with a \"skin\" that overhangs 6 inches. In the future I'd like it to have 2 feet of depth *and* two 2-foot beams on the bottom to finish out the rectangular prism.\r\n\r\nNext steps:\r\n\r\n- Make jigs for sawing and drilling straight.\r\n- Add center beam(s) under particle board for less wobbling.\r\n- Add two 2-foot beams on the bottom for stability.\r\n- Increase depth from 1 foot to 2 feet.\r\n- ???\r\n\r\n#grid-beam",
