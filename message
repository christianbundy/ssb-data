My first implementation just showed all of the blobs on one HTML page with an `<img>` element pointing to each of them, but that takes forever a few seconds to load and doesn't show non-image blobs.\r\n\r\nI think we need some way to display / filter the blobs better, but I couldn't think of any good filters that would show the blobs I'd like to see. Maybe:\r\n\r\n- Blobs only referenced by one feed?\r\n- Biggest blobs?\r\n- Blobs referenced by no feeds (your own blobs + [sympathy blobs](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-blobs/issues/23)\r\n\r\nContent rating would be goo, and I'd imagine that collaboratively we could label / annotate a *ton* of blobs.",
