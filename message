Patchwork search isn't finding anything either.\n\nAssuming you're on the latest Patchwork, the files you care about:\n\n- `~/.ssb/secret` -- your keypair, don't share or lose it!\n- `~/.ssb/conn.json` -- list of peers you know about (old version was called `gossip.json`)\n- `~/.ssb/flume/log.offset` -- optional, all of the posts you've already downloaded\n\nTransferring to a new machine:\n\n1. Make sure you're never in a scenario where your keypair is used by two machines. Your feed has to be a sequential list of messages, so if you have your keypair on multiple machines it's easy to accidentally fork your feed.\n2. Copy the above files to a safe place.\n3. On the target machine:\n\n```shell\nmkdir -p ~/.ssb/flume/\ncp /path/to/backup/secret ~/.ssb/secret\ncp /path/to/backup/conn.json ~/.ssb/conn.json\n\n# optional\ncp /path/to/backup/log.offset ~/.ssb/flume/log.offset\n```\n\nStart your client of choice, grab some tea while you wait for it to finish indexing, and confirm that all of your posts are there. If you didn't copy your `log.offset` you'll receive messages out of order, and you should double-check that all of your messages are on your profile before publishing any messages.\n\n**A common problem to avoid:** If you only copy `~/.ssb/secret` and try to use a pub invite instead of backing up `conn.json`, you're going to have a bad time. Using an invite publishes a message to your feed, which means that everything you do on that account will occur on a fork (where nobody can see you). If you even have this happen, reach out to someone (anyone!) via a side-channel and we'll work with you to fix you up.",
