I was frustrated by the fact that `npm --global install` was [broken by default](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally), so I made a [small module](https://github.com/christianbundy/global-install) that just:\r\n\r\n- runs `npm --global install <module>`\r\n- if that fails and we're on a unix system, deploy the workaround that the documentation suggests\r\n- if the workaround succeeds, retry `npm --global install <module>`\r\n\r\nThere's a screencast of it [here](https://asciinema.org/a/erISoxaH5vLjtzFsvmaj0zzoz).\r\n\r\nRegarding the domains, you might be interested in this issue: https://github.com/fraction/oasis/issues/396\r\n\r\nTL;DR: sorry this broke stuff, there are a few ways to fix this problem (including `allowHosts`) with various trade-offs, but any of them would work just fine",
