Using TLS doesn't mean that you have to buy into the certificate authority system, you can easily use a self-signed certificate (or just use plain HTTP, since our messages are tamper-proof and private messages are already encrypted). TLS isn't sleek, but it's ubiquitous enough to be 'boring technology' IMO.",
