I'm bumping into a problem where these queries don't return until the indexes are 100% up-to-date, whereas I really just want the indexes to return whatever they have right now.\r\n\r\nI could've sworn there was a way to do this, but I can't find it anymore. Anyone know how I might do it?\r\n\r\n#ssbc #ssb-learning #ssb-dev #ssb-query #ssb-backlinks #ssb-help",
