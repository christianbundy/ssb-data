I feel like thats a fundamentally different conversation form, so should be a different type of message or something\n\nIs it different? I thought that each message referenced the previous message that it's replying to, so non-linear threads are already a thing (?), it's just that we show them linearly. Is that right, or am I misunderstanding? I think deep nesting and fractal discussions are incredibly useful, but I also spent almost a decade (ðŸ˜±) on Reddit so I'm biased.\n\n> I've experimented with this and found message content much wider than 850px starts to look really stringy (short posts become a single narrow line of text) and longer posts get harder to scan.\n\nI like the guideline of [45-90em](https://practicaltypography.com/line-length.html), and my personal preference is definitely on the shorter side of that (although again, I know that's just preference).",
