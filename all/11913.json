I can't find it anywhere) that said something like:\n\n\"hey I noticed that I've been reaching out lots but you haven't really been hitting the ball back over the fence\"\n\nI think there was some other stuff about scheduling that specific thing, but I really cherish that message. It kind of sucked to read but it was also *awesome* because he cared enough to be honest with me and point to a thing I hadn't really been aware of. I don't know how to translate this into a solid \"interface guide\" but I suppose I want to highlight the data point as a Thing You Should Do, because it really meant a lot to me.\n\n#interface-guide",
