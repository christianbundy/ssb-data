I was a bit surprised by some behavior that I found which I *think* is the current implementation, where if you request an incorrect offset (e.g. 42, if the valid ones are 30 and 48) then it will return a message without validating that it also has the same length appended after the message ends.\n\nI'm having the same feelings about the fact that a list of *operations* rather than data might be useful. It's true that [Scuttlebutt](%p++m9rdfZekCzz3sN2X8tu+MeYRzbP1CkVc63qyJyWw=.sha256) has that semantic, where each message is a type, but it might be really nice for flumedb items to have this capability. I'm still bummed that we don't have rebuilds on all flumeviews, but I suppose that will come with time.",
