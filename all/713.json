I managed to find a way to turn it off in the settings, but this kind of distractions on by default is extremely toxic.\n\nSame, especially because these seem to be the types of things that most people leave on, which seems to have a net negative on the society that *everyone* inhabits.\n\n> Another example, is thumbnail+click bait title at the bottom of an article. You need to read it to evaluate whether you should click it, and by that time it's already hooked you. News sites are really bad at this.\n\nI didn't even think of that, but you're right -- I went to the bottom of an Aeon article and saw like six suggested articles. Fortunately uBlock makes it *super* easy to permanently block them (why haven't I used it until today?!), but almost everyone is going to stick to the defaults anyway.",
