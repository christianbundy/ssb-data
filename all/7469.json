Any suggestions on how to pass the time and fight the urge to go to work anyway? I know I should rest, but I can't think of anything to do. My buddy [@Bram](@eWOvcKppzZfzr04jpftrvwOUCzF847PQZ942hI3FCsI=.ed25519) saw [Free State of Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_State_of_Jones_(film)) last night and recommended it to me, plus I just bought Skyrim on sale for $20, but I'd love some more recommendations on things to do once I'm done with those.\n\nThanks all. :heart: ",
