    "text": "> I think this is a powerful way to say that as a community we don't want X in it.\n\nThis is how I use blocks, personally. I've used blocks in three ways:\n\n- **My test accounts.** I'm sure I could use a test network, but sometimes I'm lazy and want to test things locally. Whenever I use a test account I'll always block it afterward so I'm not replicating my garbage onto the rest of the network.\n- **Ideological garbage.** We all bring different ideologies to the table, and I'm sure many of us (maybe even myself) would qualify as \"extremists\" in one sense or another, but there are some ideologies that are so twisted that I don't feel comfortable hosting or replicating them.\n- **[Bullshit and patter](%6/eEWhHVwu2P02PDPuOZAaZyJ+CZplRgqNR7wVcDdfE=.sha256).** This could probably be categorized as \"ideological garbage\", but I think it's especially toxic (and offensive) to put up billboards in the space shared by our community.",
