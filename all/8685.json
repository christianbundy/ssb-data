    "text": "Wow, this was a really cool thread to open this morning -- thanks for all of the responses. ❤ Should we each just come up with our own availability, or would it be helpful to have an inverse [scry](%7aw//w7CkOyBSV5H8iEYs2dhvV3CP4ANsvByIgrqEPI=.sha256) to minimize overlap in time and space?\n\nTo give a concrete example, I'd imagine posting something like:\n\n> # I'm hosting office hours (!)\n>\n> Others in our community have spent *tons* of time and energy helping me learn about Scuttlebutt, and I'd love to host office hours to redirect some of that back into our community.\n>\n> I'd love to chat, answer questions, and maybe even hack on some code. This is an experiment in collaboration and community, so it may be a bit more open-ended than you'd expect from traditional office hours.\n>\n> I'll be available for about an hour starting on Friday, February 1st at 15:00 UTC, and I'm planning to repeat this every two weeks for *at least* eight weeks (four iterations).\n>\n> The best ways to join are:\n>\n> - voice chat via Mumble (example.com, password is `hunter2`)\n> - post messages to `[this gathering](%...)`\n> - send a message over #ssb-chat\n>\n> I'll plan on writing up a brief summary afterward, which I'll share as a message on this thread for anyone who couldn't attend. I'd also encourage you to check out #office-hours, where you'll find some other fine folks practicing a similar experiment.\n\nAny recommendations or ambiguities? I'm also interested in experimenting with:\n\n- [alternating times](%SZy3Geg4HxjZkkM3BTF/RwYM9cA6ITNUcp8xEwAGyjI=.sha256)\n- [Jitsi](%iMxByvHWfdPW4btF4lTMxQtt2tAmxq8d4G+tV04L+VQ=.sha256)\n- [NextCloud Talk](%I38ZutMj+dFO+3kqgPHUyTirlCejnT+tFeifPMOIEuI=.sha256)",
