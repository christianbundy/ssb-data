I'm not using coherence, it's just 100% static HTML and CSS rendered on the server and passed over HTTP, but I *am* excited to try coherence at some point. It satisfies both the \"responsive web app for people with JS\" and \"accessible web app for everyone\" but I *do* sort of wish that I could share it as a flat HTML file as well. Can't have everything, I guess.\n\n> also adding, that no matter if itâ€™s a SPA or something rendered on the server, i love browser based apps because they come with all the browser features i.e. bookmarks, tabs, and multiple windows.\n\nSame! I wish HTML/CSS/JS were simple enough that an indie developer could build a basic browser by themselves, but I don't think there are many runtime environments that are *that* simple. ",
