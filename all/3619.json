    "text": "Just to add to the dogpile: ssb-chess is some of the most fun I've had on the web, and it feels like what my buddy Jordan refers to as \"co-puttering\". I never knew the actual definition of \"putter\" until now, but it's something like:\n\n> To be active, but not excessively busy, at a task or a series of tasks.\n\nIt feels good to connect and ~~lose at~~ play chess with friends slowly, and it makes it especially easy to talk about what you're doing in the real world because it isn't a real-time thing where you need to be *busy* and concentrate all of your attention at a screen. I think this is the kind of thing that differentiates Scuttlebutt from other decent(ralized) technology, and the feedback loop of chess over SSB feels sustainable and *good*. Thanks.",
