On one hand, having super short hair makes it *very* difficult to mess up. On the other hand, I think having hair is conventional and more \"normal\" for most people I interact with. Hats are probably a solid middle ground, but I've never really tried them for more than a few hours.\n\nThat's basically the same routine I'd been using when I had long hair, but eventually I started getting dandruff and realized that spending a ton of money to maintain a pain-in-the-ass haircut didn't really align with how I'd like to live my life. Doctor Bronners and orange pumice soap are the best, I love them both.\n\nJust checked out that channel and it looks really sweet, I just subscribed. I've been trying to stick to buying only produce and bulk foods at the grocery store, but being able to extend that to *all* store-bought products would be fantastic. Hell, I'd *love* to make my own medications but I'd rather not have The Authorities kicking down my door for manufacturing over-the-counter drugs. :pill: ",
