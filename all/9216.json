They have great docs, and when reading about their [schemas](https://docs.slatejs.org/guides/schemas) and [data model](https://docs.slatejs.org/guides/data-model) I was reminded of atjson.\n\nIt looks like both JS and the DOM may already have ways of making cross-boundary selections (e.g. \"h1 and half the first paragraph\"? This is news to me, but I'm excited that this problem can be tackled in a few different ways."
