Throughout the camp I felt like these crews came closer together and created more intersections, but *personally* I didn't feel like these coagulated into any big groups. On the other hand, I felt a sense of belonging among a handful of different crews, so it's possible that I have a blind spot (or lots of them!). I had a really great time and felt like I was welcome everywhere.\n\nI think my only real tension was trying to be transparent about my relationship with Verse without giving the wrong impression. I made a few new scuttle-friends who thought I was a founder or employee at Verse, so I felt self-conscious about correcting misunderstandings without giving the vibe that I wanted to disassociate from Verse in general. This is probably a normal and healthy process while intermingling with new friends, but I was feeling a bit sensitive about it and wanted to acknowledge my weird feels along with all of the happy feels I had.\n\nI felt this wonderful symmetry where I saw cross-polination that increased the quantity and magnitude of connections, where at the same time I saw a handful of new crews (or \"working groups\") form which are taking on exciting and important work. I'm full of anticipation just thinking about where we'll be the next time we can all get together. ",
