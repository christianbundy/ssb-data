I looked for an off-the-shelf solution and found levelup, which seems like a well-specified list of API methods that's at least adjacent to what we do *plus* since we use level it might not be too difficult.\n\nThe only big gotchas that I came up with:\n\n- levelup doesn't support `append()`, which might be fine (?) since we use a `since` value anyway\n- levelup doesn't support `rebuild()`, but reduce views could handle that internally when they  get a `del()`\n- levelup doesn't support `createSink()`, but I think `iterator()` does what we need",
