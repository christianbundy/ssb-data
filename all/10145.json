You're never bothering me, I always appreciate when you let me know something breaking. ‚ù§\n\nMy understanding is that [npm-scripts should have access to dependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts#path) in their path, maybe `PATH` is getting messed with or `sh` isn't actually running the right shell? I can see this directory in your path: `/var/local/src/p/patchbay/node_modules/.bin`, could you run `ls` in that directory and make sure electron-builder is there? Or maybe run `npm bin` and ensure it outputs that directory? \n\nAs usual, I've got more questions than answers I'm afraid. ",
