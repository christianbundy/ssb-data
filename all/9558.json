I've seen a bunch, but they tend to fall into two categories:\n\n- \"open core\" hosted solutions that seem like they'll create vendor lock-in\n- completely open source solutions that assume you're a developer\n\nBonus points for not assuming my repository is on GitHub, but I suppose that isn't the end of the world.\n\n\n#help #static-site #cms #webdev",
