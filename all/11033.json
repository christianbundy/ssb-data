Or just that it takes a long time to move between different pages? If it says \"indexing...\" at the top every time you click a link that's unexpected behavior.\n\nI know that the tags page is super slow (and hasn't been touched in a long time), but the public and private views shouldn't be doing anything special. I'm working on a low-resource alternative to Patchwork that runs its interface in a web browser, but it's very much a work in progress. There's also #patchfoo, but in my experience it takes a bit of effort to install and configure.",
