I don't think that there's a way to disable [REALLY LARGE EMOJIS](%LAGvVzSNA/gbize/f+UeJYDEBIqWIMMDmvFZcpIY1Fk=.sha256), although I'll admit that it isn't my personal preference either. Usually I'll look up the actual unicode character and use that so it doesn't get rendered huge. For example, I'll use ‚ù§ rather than :heart:, but I'm not sure it'll look the same for everyone.",
