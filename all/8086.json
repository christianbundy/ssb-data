Would it possible to publish those to npm or push their code to GitHub? I'm familiar with Scuttlebutt, Git, and npm, and I'm **super excited about their intersection** but I'm still stuck using centralized platforms because I'm struggling to get started. :confused: \n\nIf there's anything I can do to help, please let me know. I uninstalled my last working install because it was crashing `npm -g update`, and now I'm having a problem running `sbot` with explicit plugins because it causes [a problem with ssb-links](https://github.com/ssbc/ssb-links/issues/new).\n\nThanks! I'm really looking forward to trying out git-ssb-web issues. :heart:\n\ncc: #git-ssb #ssb-npm #git-ssb-web #ssb-npm-registry  #ssb-links ",
