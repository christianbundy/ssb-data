    "text": "# What's the philosophical term for \"axes of control\"?\n\nI have this concept of axes of willpower in my head but I can't find any references to it on the web. I'm sure I just have the words wrong, but I'm trying to describe the dimensionality of willpower in a given game/scenario. For example, if you can make decisions on one spectrum (choosing \"left\" versus \"right\" or something) then you'd have one axis of control. To extend the example, if you were controlling a joystick, you'd have two axes of choice.\n\nI've also got this other note in my head that there have been estimates about how many axes humans consiousness has, but it's highly controversial. **Any chance someone knows what concept I'm thinking of?** Hopefully I haven't got the words too far off."
