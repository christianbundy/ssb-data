I think payment processing companies can do this because it doesn't require self-reporting, but I *personally* wouldn't tell a company \"hey every month we need to report our revenue to an open source project and pay them\". Maybe I'm the minority though.)\n\nI like the ideas behind [`licensezero quote`](https://licensezero.com/) to figure out how much licensing relevant open source projects would cost, and I'd imagine that having the option to use crypto-currencies would be very popular.",
