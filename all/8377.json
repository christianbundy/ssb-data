The closest that I can come up with is \"back-explanation\", but I'm looking for a word that explains a pattern after the fact, even though it wasn't the original intention.\n\nFor example, Alice randomly chooses what to eat for lunch each day, but for three weeks in a row Bob notices that she eats pizza on Friday. The back-explanantion might be \"Alice celebrates a recurring holiday called Pizza Friday\", which is completely untrue but still explains the phenomena.\n\nI think a backronym would be a type of back-explanation, but I'm sure there *must* be a better word for it... right?"
