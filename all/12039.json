My \"quick thoughts\" might have been a bit too quick, I think I should've been more considerate about how it felt to open this thread.\n\n[@mix](@ye+QM09iPcDJD6YvQYjoQc7sLF/IFhmNbEqgdzQo3lQ=.ed25519) \n\nI think this is part of a larger conversation that's super important, and none of us would be talking about it right now if you hadn't brought it up. I don't think I'm super keen on this specific proposal but **I'm hyped about the conversation** and I really appreciate that you put in the energy to get it started. I think it's a Very Good Thing to support our friends and try to make FOSS more sustainable, and since this discussion is pushing for that I think it's a Very Good Thing as well. ðŸ’“ ðŸš€",
