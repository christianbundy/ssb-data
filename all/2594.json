How did you like D-prime? I've never tried E-prime for more than a few minutes, but it seems like most of the value comes from removing \"is\" from identity and predication.\n\n[@squicc](@k9xSaKW2kc+Ko8Vx+xvFmVC5gEi/tIA2TpV6EBQ7MPw=.ed25519) \n\nI think you're onto something -- and I forgot how frustrating those sentences are. Maybe [happy path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path) sentences or [desire path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path) sentences would be more appropriate? I'm surprised that this isn't already a thing.",
