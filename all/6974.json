    "text": "I've had a few bits of free time where I felt ready to work on this, but unsure *where* to work on this. My intuition is to just create a repo that converts sigil links to #ssb-uri format, but it seems like this could also be baked straight into ssb-ref. Any opinions here? If not, I'll likely just start this work in its own repo.",
