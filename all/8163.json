I'm working on [this](%CjpxSXm13xAm/E9WEFjkXD7kMzjurEgUK4hgh/+mA/k=.sha256), which seems straightforward, although I agree that trying to *propagate* deletion across the network would require loads of nuance.\n\nFor what it's worth, this thread is a continuation of our discussion [here](%MG1K47CxX1zaL1fytFoLdOZ8jC2wFY+WOukzUfy/yjk=.sha256), the only change is that I'm trying to avoid a full rebuild of each flumeview when we only delete a single message. Do you think that's viable, or do you think there's a better way to implement this?",
