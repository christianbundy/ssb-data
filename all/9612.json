Click to check it out — or make a contribution!\n\nNothing ground-breaking, but a nice looking site with lots of options for \"ethical\" software options.\n\nI was curious about how they defined \"ethical\" and found this:\n\n> We know that “ethical” isn’t an objective word — it can mean different things to different people.\n>\n> But for us, ethical means moving in the direction of least possible harm against other people, animals and the planet.\n\n\n#ethical #software #lists",
