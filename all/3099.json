Fingers crossed that #SocialCoop survives, but it seems like it may be too tangled up in consensus. I've just spent a few minutes on the Matrix chat and it sounds like it's been going on for a while. Here's my best summary (in the hopes that someone in the future will correct me):\n\n- deciding who to federate or block is controversial\n- deciding what to host is controversial\n- maintenance is hard and the Mastodon instance wasn't up-to-date\n- the instance was too old to see cross-instance \"reports\" for abusive content\n- governance is hard and the moderation jury struggled to keep everyone happy\n- someone on the instance expressed that they were uncomfortable generalizing that Nazi = bad because ~\"Nazi is a catch-all term\"\n- the members spoke out against the author but the post remained up\n- other instances started blocking the instance for hosting Nazi normalization\n- lots of discussion round and round in the Loomio and Matrix chat, but no action\n- eventually the author left the instance and started somewhere else\n- the instance is currently in crisis to resolve \"social and technical debt\"\n\nI've probably screwed up the story, but hopefully Cunningham's Law comes into effect.\n\nPotentially relevant: #against-consensus ( #againstconsensus )",
