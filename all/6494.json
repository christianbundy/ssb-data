The current behavior is simple:\n\n- Threads with no activity for 60 days will be marked as stale.\n- A comment will be posted saying ~\"this is stale and will be closed in 7 days unless there's activity\"\n- If 7 days pass without any activity, the issue/PR will be closed.\n\nI don't think closing stale issues is controversial, but the onslaught of emails isn't my favorite. I like to tinker, so I'm tempted to immediately start trying different settings, but for the sake of science I'm going to leave the defaults for at least a week and see where the pain points are. **This thread should serve as a forum to discuss, complain, and navel-gaze about stale issues.**\n\nMy first instinct is to disable the warning comment, so that we only get the email about how the issue is closed, but it seems a bit impolite. Maybe a closing comment would be more appropriate? The [configuration file](https://github.com/ssbc/secure-scuttlebutt/blob/master/.github/stale.yml) is pretty simple, so it should be easy to make any changes that we'd like.\n\n**In case of emergency:** if the bot goes rogue and/or becomes sentient, it can easily be disabled in the [GitHub settings for the org](https://github.com/organizations/ssbc/settings/installations/407234). I don't have any reason to be concerned, but I like having a high [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor).",
