Specifically, I'd like to propose:\n\n- Supporting *at least* the following Node LTS versions:\n  - latest (10)\n  - active (8)\n- Using ESLint with *at least* the recommended defaults \n- Ensuring that `npm test` succeeds, potentially with a `.travis.yml` (or eventually #ssb-ci)\n- Ensuring that all repositories and their dependencies have compatible licenses\n\nAnd, in the interest of sharing my biases, here are my *personal preferences* that I'm **not proposing**:\n\n- Using Babel to use the latest JavaScript without worrying about old compatibility\n- Using [AirBnb's style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)\n- Using the same license in all repositories for maximum consistency\n\nI'd love to hear whether others have opinions on the first list, or whether agreeing to some defaults is too consensus-y for you wonderful rascals. I'd be happy to work on any of this, as my work at $dayjob is mostly infrastructure work and the devops-y work is really enjoyable for me. Looking forward to input!\n\n![hermes thank you](&Tf8ZIWfFMal0Hkj+C81dA9EGEUN7nNxWBu0Jpila4YE=.sha256) ",
