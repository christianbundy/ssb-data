It's not the same as quietly deleting stuff you're embarrassed about.\n\nMy favorite solution to this is #blob-content, where *all* content is stored in a blob. This way you could ask your friends to stop sharing a specific blob without compromising the immutable nature of your feed. In this way the order of posts is immutable but the availability of those posts is up to your social circles.",
