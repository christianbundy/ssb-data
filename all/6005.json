I don't know why I haven't thought of this before, but I think we can implement mutes *today* with no structural changes:\n\n```sh\ntarget=\"@10K9Ke665wSqJL442WQwdVhgf9516F+iSyDnTX+YZz4=.ed25519\"\nself=\"$(sbot whoami | jq -r .id)\"\nsbot publish --type contact --contact \"$target\" --blocking true --recps \"$self\"\n```\n\nIt's mind-numbingly simple: publish a `block` message, but encrypt it so that nobody else can see it. My client knows I've blocked @10K9Ke665wSqJL442WQwdVhgf9516F+iSyDnTX+YZz4=.ed25519, but nobody else should be able to see that I've blocked that feed.\n\nThe only caveat is that (at least in #patchbay) you have to restart the client or `<Ctrl> + r` to bust the cache and make the interface show the true state of whether you've blocked someone. I'm sure this would be resolved by a real mute button, but the `sbot` command was the easiest way to prototype this feature.\n\nAnyway, can anyone see my blocks, or is the mute working as expected?",
