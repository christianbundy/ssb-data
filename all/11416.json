I've been experimenting with reducing my consumption of animal products for a few years and I've been super conflicted about how open to be with it. It seems like sharing this experiment with friends might normalize veganism as a tactic, but it might also galvanize the idea that vegans are loud and obnoxious about their veganism.\n\nI'd imagine that there's a spectrum between \"keep your experiments to yourself\" and \"tell everyone you meet about what you're doing\" and I'm unclear on where the happy medium is.",
