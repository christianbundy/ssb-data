    "text": "> Basically, create ssb-legacy-conn and literally just import ssb-gossip as is, then gradually write the other pieces, replacing parts as we go. In other words **gradual migration**, not sudden rewrite.\n\nI'm +1 on this and fully support it. I'm less familiar with the gossip plugin but any organization efforts are super appreciated. Thanks for your research in detailing the current implementation, this is really great documentation."
