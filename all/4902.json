I use one of those \\\"emergency blanket\\\" tarps for search and rescue (not the mylar ones that you can rip with a pencil) unless I *know* I'm going on an overnight search, and I'm of the opinion that blankets make for fine sleeping bags **as long as you cinch the end into a small bunch for a footbox**. I've made the mistake of skipping it *once* and woke up a few times per hour with my blanket falling off the bottom of my body.\n\nAnother thing worth stressing is that the ground is cold as hell, and propping your feet up on your backpack makes all the difference in the world if you don't have a sleeping pad. Spending five or ten minutes gathering leaves and crap for a sleeping pad is also worth it, especially if it's cold out.",
