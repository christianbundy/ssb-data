Moreover, 95% of text is about \"Open a Word processor...\" or \"When printing... Looks professional\". So, seriously?\n\nYep, seriously! It's a guide on learning *the basics of typography*, so these aren't specific to web development or digital screens. Your screenshots have text that spans from one edge of your screen to another, which is *generally* not great for humans trying to read text.\n\n> But I'm feeling uncomfortable when there are big whitespace around content (and I know I'm not alone).\n\nThere's a paragraph for you! Here's a direct link, to save you the scrolling: https://practicaltypography.com/page-margins.html#fear-of-white-space\n\n> Defaults can be good for many, but not for me (well, I spent 2-3 days every time I'm reinstalling Linux on my PC just to configure that exactly as I want because distro's defaults isn't applicable for me). So, if there any technical problem behind not allowing to choose content column width or it's just about \"because someone said\"?\n\nIf you want a glossy client with reasonable defaults, Patchwork is for you! If you want a flexible client that's a bit less glossy, try Patchbay (which can be [customized](%rhEqGFW8Na8ynG3Fz4XTSPWu5PAcUf9TLmZyr50+zCU=.sha256))! There's no \"someone said\" going on, it's just the current state of the applications. All of this is free/libre/open-source/etc, so you're welcome to clone, fork, and contribute to any client you'd like. We *all* want better clients, and we'd love your help to improve what we have! ",
