Please feel free to ping me if we get any bug reports on the new code and I'll happily come clean up my mess.\n\nI think leveldown@1.7.2 came from the devDep being installed as a dependency of patchbay (and patchbay-dark-crystal (and scuttle-dark-crystal)), but it all looks cleared up now. I'm excited to remove the hacky workaround from the Arch packages.\n\nBy the way, I posted this [on GitHub](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttle-invite/pull/8#issuecomment-414849700) but it's likely more appropriate here:\n\n> Now that I'm in the ssbc org I've just been pushing branches as `foo` or `@christianbundy/foo`, but still doing my regular development flow (branch off master, open a PR, await review). Is that how I should still be working? I don't want to abuse `master` by merging branches willy nilly, but I'm also hesitant to keep adding code to the review pile and creating a backlog of work for others to review. We can also discuss on SSB if that's better than on a random PR.",
