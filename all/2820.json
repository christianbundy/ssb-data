Is there a way to do that? I was able to ~~steal~~ borrow some functions from `index.js` to take the tokenized object as input and produce CSS, but I'm having trouble taking the tokenized object as input and turning it back into MCSS.\n\nIs there a reasonable way to do this, or have I entered the void of mayhem and confusion?",
