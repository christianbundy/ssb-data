Sometimes being an adult means changing batteries or cleaning up cat vomit, sometimes it means dropping what you're doing to do a favor for someone, and sometimes it means dealing with emergencies and other big stuff when nobody else is stepping forward to handle it.\n\nI don't know which factors about a situation or relationship make me feel like an adult (or not), but it's always very clear in the moment whether I'm an adult or whether I'm just a kid who should do what they're told. I'd be curious whether others feel the same way.",
