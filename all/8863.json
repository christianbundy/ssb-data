Maybe it'd be useful for Scuttlebutt post previews?\n\nThings I like:\n\n- the title isn't gigantic\n- the title is a link to the post (woop)\n- the first paragraph is shown by default (woop woop)\n- it's enough information to understand the gist of the post\n- it's not so much information that it's overstimulating or annoying\n\nIn cases where there isn't a title, maybe the first two paragraphs should be shown? or just one? I don't have any strong opinions but I thought it was cool and wanted to share.",
