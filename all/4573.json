Here's what I've got:\n\n- a working Node application\n  - currently running live on a server\n  - running Node 0.10 (!)\n- minimal `package.json`\n  - small number of dependencies\n  - dependency tree is deep and wide\n- a bunch of errors when I run `npm install`\n  - dependencies won't install on modern Node versions\n  - backward-incompatible changes have been made by deep dependencies\n  - currently no way to run the application without copying `node_modules` from the working copy\n\nNot good. My first thought was to run `npm shrinkwrap` on the `node_modules`, but shrinkwraps are only supported in NPM 3+ (Node 5). I can *make* the shrinkwrap, but the NPM that ships with Node 0.10  doesn't know anything about shrinkwraps. My current theory is that I can recursively walk though the shrinkwrap and shell out to `npm install $dependency`, but I feel like there has to be a better solution.\n\nDoes anyone else have any clever ideas?\n\n#node #npm #javascript #js",
