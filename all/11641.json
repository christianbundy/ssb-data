We tried to go without an AC during our first year but even with the blinds closed all day it was common for the house to remain uncomfortably hot for weeks at a time. Maybe it's a ventilation problem? Or maybe just a \"get used to it\" problem, since air conditioners are a luxury item that I really don't *need*.\n\nI was actually expecting that the cats would get ridiculously warm, but somehow even with their fur and inability to sweat they love hanging out in direct sunlight during the warmest parts of the day.",
