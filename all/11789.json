To be blunt, I don't think that Jordan Peterson's claims about C-16 are supported by any evidence in our material reality, and it seems like more of a persecution fantasy that has somehow gone viral. Having this conversation should be simple because C-16 passed a long time ago, so we *should* be able to look around and see which predictions have come true in Canada.\n\n> My understanding of the criticism is the bill relates to the subjective nature of the pronouns (ze, zir, etc) and associating this through changes in other related legal frameworks to compel speech, with risk of imprisonment\n\nCould you point to which part of the bill compels you to use preferred pronouns? Or which crimes you might be charged with to create a \"risk of imprisonment\"? Even better would be examples of prosecution since C-16 passed. My understanding of the anti-discrimation laws of Canada is very limited, but I'm under the impression that the rules look like this:\n\n- You can always call people by their name or respectful gender-neutral pronouns.\n- If you'd like, you can use gendered pronouns to refer to people.\n- If you use gendered pronouns, they should be pronouns that people are comfortable with.\n- If you're a landlord or a public servant, you are legally required to *try* to follow the above rule while at work.\n\n> and basing this on a gender theory which goes against the scientific literature.\n\nThis is a bold claim that I don't want to go unchallenged, but I think we should probably resolve this conversation before changing topics. I'm resisting the temptation to go into more detail on what you think \"the scientific literature\" has reached consensus on. Let's loop back around on this later?\n\n> His concern is that now the bill is passed, his talk about criticizing the bill or other talks around psychological gender science would be illegal, or very easy for people to shut down\n\nIf this was true then atheism would be illegal in Canada. You're welcome to criticize whoever you'd like, and given that Jordan Peterson has seen no legal consequences I think it's safe to say that his \"the government is coming to take your pronouns\" fear-mongering was either misguided or fraudulent. Maybe you could share why you find his arguments about this so convincing?",
