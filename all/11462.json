    "text": "- **Tell us something unexpected that was awesome!** Butts everywhere. I couldn't find a room that didn't already have Scuttlebutt folks which made for a really friendly and fun environment where there was always a friend around. \n- **Did you drink tea? What was the flavour?** Does coffee count? I had black coffee and I tried some coffee on nitro (which was frothy because it's full of nitrogen) and I found out that I strongly prefer black coffee.\n- **Are you new to SSB, how do you find it so far?** ðŸ™ƒ\n- **Did you discover some new project there that excited you? Tell us more!** I'm much more interested and curious about Dat and LibreMesh and much *less* interested and curious about \"decentralized identity at Microsoft\".\n- **Did you meet someone for the first time that youâ€™d wanted to meet?** So many scuttle-friends! I'd like to tag a bunch of people but I'm afraid I'll accidentally leave someone out.\n- **What made you laugh?** I don't remember anything specific, but I remember lots of hearty laughing throughout the weekend. Also: a disproportionate number of laughs were [@sean](@N/vWpVVdD1e8IbACUQE4EVGL6+aodQfbQZ8ByC+k79s=.ed25519)-induced, he's funny as hell.\n- **How were the chilly summer evenings on the tents?** They weren't too bad, but I was taking advantage of sleeping pad and a 30 degree (F) sleeping bag. There were a couple times where I woke up chilly, but that only happened when I didn't zip up my bag all the way.\n- **Was it your first time camping? Did you like it?** It wasn't my first time camping, but I loved it. On the other hand, it *was* the first time using a handful of features on my tent that [@jordan](@6hwStvpVIQkziTyk2iK0o8lWSU1OdUXzvIl1SdXx6N4=.ed25519) pointed out. The downside of \"DIY all the things\" is that you rarely learn The Right Way to do things, so I definitely learned a few best practices when using my tent.",
