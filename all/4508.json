The idea is to avoid jumbled hashtags like #thisexample because lots of software will parse it as one big word. Alternatively, you can use:\n\n- **CamelCase:** #ThisExample\n- **Hyphenation:** #this-example\n- **Underscore (uncommon):** #this_example\n\nMy tendency is to use hyphens so that it isn't affected by uppercase/lowercase shenanigans, but that may be a personal preference. It's worth noting that [the Unicode standard](http://unicode.org/reports/tr31/#hashtag_identifiers) specifies that hashtags can use `-`, `_`, or `+`, so those are all technically valid contendors.\n\nI've been dreaming up some idea on #synonyms and how to merge channels/tags that only differ on word separation, but that's a story for another thread.",
