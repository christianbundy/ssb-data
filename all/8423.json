My internet is out, so all I've got is Scuttlebutt, and I'm not feeling great today so I'm working from home. I'm feeling very excited about going to NZ for scuttle-fest, and a little bit bad about how awful I've been at keeping up on my ssb-chess games. Also, a bit hungry, but I'll probably wait until noon to eat. All in all: it's going alright over here.\n\nHow the hell are you?",
