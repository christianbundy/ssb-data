I'm wondering whether maybe it'd be more wise to extract the shared MCSS between the themes as a base, so that the dark theme is `base + diffDark` and the light theme is `base + diffLight`, that way the light theme doesn't bleed through into the dark theme. Anyway, the detokenizer (?) seems to be working great, it's just the object manipulation that needs some work.\n\n![broken diffDark theme](&vIqtvg5Ph8abvjmq2Gnwvci4kv1rYc24kme5oVlM0Zc=.sha256)\n",
