Your example is perfectly compatible with most forms of [market socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_socialism) -- there's nothing capitalist about it. If you want to give an example of capitalism I'd suggest introducing the landlord who owns all of the land and equipment involved.\n\nThe landlord might offer to pay the workers to catch fish and chop wood, and after eating some of the fish (grilled over a large fire) he'd sell the leftovers back to the workers for their daily pay. The workers might not have enough left over to be able to rent a camping site from their landlord, but maybe our generous landlord could also pay them to produce more saws and fishing poles, that way the landlord could hire more employees to work the land.",
