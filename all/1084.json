    "text": "# Always Be Blocking (Advertisements)\n\nIt's a simple philosophy: advertisements on the web, the airwaves, and billboards are industrial waste products that have no benefit to the vast majority of society. As such, I want to recommend blocking them whenever possible.\n\n## Web\n\nBlocking advertisements on the web is easy. Install [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock). Avoid \"Adblock\", \"Adblock Plus\", \"uBlock\", and other tools that sell access to advertisement companies. If you're familiar with computers then I recommend [medium mode](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode:-medium-mode). Please note that blocking ads on the web only blocks *obvious* advertisements, but don't forget that most websites have a product to sell (or want to make you their product).\n\n## Airwaves\n\nPlease take the last sentence from the last paragraph and distill it. Television and radio is run on advertismenets, and you should trust little of what you see and hear. You can fight obvious ads by muting the volume, looking away, or otherwise *not* learning the catchy new jingle for the new *Very Coldâ„¢* beer.\n\n## Billboards\n\nWhen I was younger I tried to avoid eye contact when I was in trouble. My mom used to use her hands as blinders and repeat \"look at me\" and I'd reply \"I can't\" while looking *anywhere* but toward her. Be like me, except listen to your mom more often. She knows lots of stuff. The point is that *not* looking at stuff is silly but there's also no reason to subject yourself to commercial propaganda.\n\n## Seriously?\n\nI might be exaggerating my ~~hatred~~ strong feelings against advertisements a bit, but for the most part I'm being serious. I *do* use an ad blocker, I mute radio and TV ads, and I try to avoid looking at advertisements for too long. I usually look at street art instead of billboards, which I think is an improvement in every category. Mostly I just wanted to keep evangelizing for uBlock Origin and keep pushing for an ad-free future."
