I was thinking that [espree](https://github.com/eslint/espree) would be useful for making sure you're *only* installing when a string literal is passed, but that's probably too much of a footgun. My use-case is that I have a ton of tiny experiments where even *naming the file* seems like overkill but that I'd like the dependency versions to be saved anyway. Plus it was a good way to experiment with the `debug` package, I've been looking for an excuse to play around with it a bit more.",
