It's always such a relief to look around and find others who are concerned about the same problems and looking in the same direction for solutions.\n\n---\n\n[@dominic](@EMovhfIrFk4NihAKnRNhrfRaqIhBv1Wj8pTxJNgvCCY=.ed25519)\n\nThat sounds really rad. There are a few spots in Portland where there are trees on both sides of the street which create a ton of wonderful shade and the feeling that you're in a much more intimate space. I'd love to live somewhere like that -- maybe a good spot to do some tree climbing. ðŸŒ³\n\n---\n\n[@mary](@SXVoA/7CuMRS5IDTNsO8HU2PvCIVq8HKUUx/k+idDiQ=.ed25519) \n\nHoly crap, what a bunch of awesome resources. I'm loving the idea of retrosuburbia, I might have to snag a copy. I'll likely come back to this thread a few times as I dive deeper down the rabbit hole, I love all of your backlinks.\n\nI think my focus on population density is that I'd like to live in a community that *could* be self-sufficient if that ever became necessary, and while Portland has lovely community gardens and green rooftops and lots of tree cover it doesn't seem like we could provide our own food / water / energy if we needed to. That feels a bit scary, and seems like it makes me dependent on a lot of systems I'm interested in dismantling. Right now the city feels a bit like a lost cause --we've packed so much housing into such a tight space that it doesn't seem like it could ever become self-sufficient, but I'm also woefully uninformed on the subject.\n\nThe polar opposite to population density doesn't seem great either: while I love the feeling of being completely alone in nature for short periods of time, resilient communities are hard to build if you live in the middle of nowhere and you have spend 20 minutes in a car just to see your neighbors. I'd imagine this would make communication and exchange difficult, although gossip protocols would immediately become mandatory. ðŸ¦€\n\nI'm sure there's a happy medium somewhere, but I'm not sure how to find it. I like the idea of retrofitting suburbia to build a beautiful solarpunk future, but I guess I'm just just interested in making sure the math checks out before I sign a lease or get a mortgage or organize a housing co-op. Disclaimer: I might be biased against suburbs because I grew up in one and had the same experience where you *had* to drive everywhere. My neighborhood didn't even have sidewalks, although it *did* have a small forested area with paved trails so I can't complain too much.",
