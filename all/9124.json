You have a few options:\n\n- Use a symlink so that the file is doesn't actually have to exist in your home directory.\n- Run Patchwork with `export HOME=/somewhere/over/the/rainbow; npm start` or something so it looks elsewhere.\n\nBacklink: I'd like to use the [XDG base directory specification](%GYRV3ubdT0awysbiIO5SpVUehiFxhHxg9QHq9r68qf0=.sha256) so that you can move specific types of Scuttlebutt data (e.g. cache) to other locations, but I'm not sure that everyone else wants to follow that standard. \n\nIf there *is* an expectation to override `HOME` with `SSB_HOME` or something I'd love to check out how other projects do it (or how specifications explain it), as it seems like it would be a really great idea.",
