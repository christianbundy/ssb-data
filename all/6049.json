I think all of us feel similarly sometimes, and knowing it's something we share makes it feel a bit less lonely. I'm sure you've got some techniques you've learned to cope with these feelings, but two that work especially well for me:\n\n- sharing my feelings out loud with someone near me\n- planning for something that I can look forward to, usually with some novelty\n\nBased on how open and courageous you're being with your feelings, my guess is you're already doing the formet, but *if not* I'd recommend telling someone you love the way you feel. I've only interacted with you on here, but I'd be shocked if you didn't have at least a handfulf of people in meatspace who would love for you to share your feelings with them. Hugs are good too, but I'm a huggy dude so maybe that's just a personal preference.\n\nI have more trouble with the latter, but that's because being burnt out doesn't lend itself very well to making plans. I'll often *try* to make myself go on a hike or walk to a park or stretch or something, but even just *planning* to spend 4 hours in bed doing nothing at all can really make you feel like you're more in control.\n\n#somebody-should develop `ssb-summon`, which teleports all of your Scuttlebutt friends to meet you at your closest pub and share a bit of solidarity, but until then here's the best I've got: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: :heart: \n\nI'm sure you know **this will pass**, but I hope you'll continue to reach out when you're feeling down. Take care, amigo.",
