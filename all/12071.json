For example, we have some money to maintain Patchwork, but it's unclear to me how much of that should be spent maintaining upstream modules. It would be great for upstream developers to say \"I need $X to keep the lights on\" and help me align those incentives. It'd be best to form personal relationships with everyone, but when time is short I wouldn't mind relying on a market-style approach where they say \"if I don't get $X then I can't afford to maintain Y and I'm going to disable the bug tracker\".\n\nðŸ¤· ",
