Interesting notes:\n\n- The host says \"she works on neuro-feedback and the brain\" but I don't think she's a neurologist.\n- Both the host and guest seem to be into paleo and such?\n- The thing I remembered was the guest talking about 24/7 *holotropic breathwork*, not a diet (starts at 18:00).\n- I'm biased, but I found the other episodes on diet (especially the anti-vegan thing) to be a bit silly and unscientific.\n- Otherwise, I'm looking forward to checking out other episodes and seeing if it's as cool as I remember!"
