Bartlett](@3r4+IyB5NVl2in6QOZHIu9oSrZud+NuVgl2GX3x2WG8=.ed25519) \n\nI really love this, it's both heartwarming and refreshing to see such utopian ideals talked about so comfortably and with such lucidity (lucidly?). \n\n> Thereâ€™s an empty space between Self and Crowd\n\nTo me, this is the clearest opportunity for improvement. There seems to be a snowball effect that I *think* is fueled by a sort of crowd exclusivity. For example, most conventional jobs seem to require 40+ hours of work per week, whereas we might see a completely different economy emerge if the norm was to split your labor across different types and sizes of groups.\n\nSpecifically, since I'm not sure whether I'll be going to [scuttle-summit](%SI/1DdkAB7cJpM/dxyi4WjEL0ZJkxXAtVB08VeY1CkM=.sha256), I've been thinking about organizing a parallel effort in my region and planning on cross-polinating to other scuttle-summits every few years (or something like that).\n\nAnyway, thanks a lot for writing this, I think I need to keep better tabs on Patchbay's `/blogs` tag so I can see these when you write them!",
