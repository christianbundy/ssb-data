That feels... bad? I don't know, I'm mainly just confused because in person you were way cool to hang with but then in these discussions I've been having a hard time understanding where you're coming from. I care about you want I want to make sure your needs are met, but I'm concerned that this doesn't actually feel like a productive conversation.\n\nIt's true that anti-discrimination laws are not zero-sum. Protecting some people from discrimination means restricting other people from doing the discrimination, and while *we all want to minimize state power* it's clear to me that anti-discrimination laws help people in the real world more than they hurt them. There are plenty of slippery slopes, but from where I'm standing this ground seems pretty solid.\n\n> Presumably you are in favor of Net Neutrality? Treating internet data as a utility? Why would we not afford the same protection to language? Surely that is so much more important?\n\nNet neutrality **is anti-discrimination legislation** that stops ISPs from charging you different rates depending on your destination. This means that your ISP can't make right-wing websites free or make Muslim websites more expensive to access. If you're okay with net neutrality you should be comfortable with anti-discrimination laws.\n\n> You know the court that this bill gives power to processes cases such as people getting offended by a student canteen sign \n\nCould you link to this case? This sounds to me like a Jordan Peterson fever dream.\n\n> now she thinks she can’t speak freely, like, say, 70% of Americans in a recent survey.\n\nDo you mean [this study](https://www.cato.org/survey-reports/state-free-speech-tolerance-america) from the [Cato Institute](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cato-institute/)? I'm hoping you're talking about something else, because the study doesn't say \"70% of Americans think they can't speak freely\".\n\n> Have we spent any time talking about how maybe nation states might be using mass media to control our thoughts?No.\n\nWhat's there to talk about? Yes, powerful people are [manufacturing consent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent) all around the world, but you don't have to be against anti-discrimination laws to be concerned about this. You're drawing a false equivalence between these ideas.\n\n> You know how around the Manhattan Project the CIA invented the term “Conspiracy Theorist”, like in the 40s or whatever, they figured out that if they called people ~~Alt Right~~ conspiracy theorists everyone would ignore them and continue their bombing the world plan? (I am not saying the Alt Right is okay, ffs.)\n\nDude. Why are you throwing \"alt right\" stuff in your posts if you don't want to have them brought up? \"Alt-right\" isn't the new \"conspiracy theorist\", and **you are the one derailing this conversation by bringing up these topics**. Just Ctrl+F this thread for \"alt-right\" and notice who is bringing them up.\n\n> Like, I attempted to ask, what is the more sophisticated 2017 version of this?\n\nI don't know, but it sounds like you're proposing that it's \"political correctness\" and anti-discrimination laws, especially regarding trans people and feminists. Maybe you could explain what you're actually proposing? The original post gives me very strong \"transitioning is unnatural and unscientific, feminists are ignorant, the government is controlling our brains, and maybe it's all connected\" vibes.\n\n> I think I maybe give up, this is just impossible to talk about and that’s SO SCARY\n\nWhat's scary about that? You're not being silenced, we're all just super confused at which points you're trying to make and why. You've been asked *lots* of questions, but then you don't answer them and you start talking about a new thing, which is frustrating for everyone involved. Maybe you could take some time and write down a concrete explanation of the point you're trying to make? It feels like you're expecting people to read between the lines and it's hard to come up with a charitable interpretation to what you're implying.",
