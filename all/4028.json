    "text": "# Subpoena\n\n> In the name of the State of Oregon you are commanded to appear as a witness on behalf ot the State of Oregon in Multnomah County circuit Court, Room ███.\n\nI'm rarely \"commanded\" to do anything, but it's been a while since I commanded to do something \"in the name\" or \"on the behalf\" of the state. Anyway, last year I woke up around 04:00 to screaming and saw a guy locking my neighbor on her snowy third-floor balcony. She asked me to call 911, one neighbor dropped a blanket to her from the roof, and others started driving around the neighborhood looking for the guy.\n\nCops showed up and waited for the apartment manager, saying things they learned from [Cops][0] like \"show's over, folks, go back inside\", and eventually my neighbor was able to get back in through a window. Last week I get a subpoena to act as a witness at a domestic violence trial, scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nHave any of you been subpoenaed or have experience being called as a witness? It's totally possible that they won't even ask me anything, but I haven't done it before and I'm wondering how it will go. I'm not happy with the way we cage humans (or other animals), so contributing to the prison industrial complex feels *not great*, but domestic violence isn't a hill I'm ever planning to die on. \n\n[0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cops_(TV_series)#Negative"
