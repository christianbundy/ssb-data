There are lots of small improvements I've been dying to work on but [unfortunately] it seems like my time is currently more useful untangling the technical stuff to make it easier for people to contribute. I'd be super happy for others to be able to focus on the design.\n\n> What do you think about visually organising sub-threads/forks of feeds to be more visibly clear?\n\n👍\n\n> How are things getting prioritized now? ad hoc? Where are concerns/features collated? Github issues?\n\nMostly ad-hoc via GitHub issues. My focus has been on our [bugs](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug+-label%3Astale) (especially those [blocking release](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22blocking+release%22)) so that we can finally release 3.12.0, plus tons of infrastructure stuff that makes contributions and releases easier (like [automated installer builds](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork/releases/tag/v3.12.0-alpha.3)).",
