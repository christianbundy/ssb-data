You've been so helpful and knowledgable across the stack that you always come to mind when I'm thinking about who to ping, so it's helpful to hear how close you are to a comfortable capacity.\n\nIf you get pinged on anything you don't have the energy for, feel free to pass it on to me (or others) and it'll get taken care of. ‚ù§ You're focusing on important and lovely work and we're all here to help you out however we can.",
