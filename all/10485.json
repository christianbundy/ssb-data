    "text": "> What I mean is a group who uses its control over a group to get involved in markets. To centrally plan how a market should work, for instance. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about.\n\nI'd suggest using a word other than socialism. Maybe you mean to argue against a [planned economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_economy)?\n\n> the complete lack of explicit control over any arbitrary market\n\nThat isn't capitalism, that's a [free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market). Again, I'd recommend you look into [market socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_socialism) to get a better view of the political landscape. It sounds to me like you think \"capitalism means freedom, socialism means hierarchy\" and I think you'd have a more nuanced understanding if you did a bit more research. My recommendation would be to start with [Socialism for Dummies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysZC0JOYYWw), but *any* research would be advantageous here.\n\nI think there's a common tendency for people who grew up in capitalist countries to recognize the unjust hierarchies of the state and move away from the authoritarian side of the [political compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_compass). This usually places us in the perspective of right-libertarianism / anarcho-capitalism, which is normal, but I'd urge you to take the critical lens you apply to states and *also* apply it to corporations and landlords. In my experience this tends to lead to [libertarian socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism), which is *not* a contradiction in terms. üôÉ Like you said [here](%aGFT6/7FY9H+M25gLz6YtcgrJ3K2rQjlcKqLh2sVc+I=.sha256):\n\n> Companies more resemble dictatorships than they do democracies.\n\nHappy to chat with you about any of this, but I'll admit that some of your posts ([example](%nWA8MGRuyGFxY1jzh1JrjPq51bxYiz7VuAzphaLiGc8=.sha256)) feel a bit like \"here's my opinion, deal with it\" rather than well-researched essays or invitations to explore a topic together, which bums me out a bit. Looking forward to exploring these subjects with you in the future. ‚ù§",
