I was originally thinking I'd make my own tahini, but I was afraid my cashews might go bad from soadking (?) so I threw them in. Luckily they ended up working well, but in the future I'll definitely make tahini and report back.\n\n[@kemitchell](@TqlPr31FOOCjuupH0L9HCJdLjWYySyibbKscNhgLoCo=.ed25519) \n\nAlways! My girlfriend and I both love to cook but we've got a small kitchen, so whoever sneaks into the kitchen first usually makes food for both of us and the other person cleans up. I'd love to start cooking for more people if I can -- there's definitely a need.",
