I've seen all of the Black Mirror episodes, but I'm getting [Maniac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_(miniseries)) vibes from everything I've seen.\n\nI've never seen an interactive TV show before (?!), so I'm also super curious about how this will get uploaded to piracy sites where linear videos are the norm. I looked around an found a five-hour dump of the series, but there's currently no way to navigate through the choices.",
