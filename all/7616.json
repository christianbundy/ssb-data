Normal URL/URI extractors would not work well.\n\nIf you haven't already, I'd recommend at least skimming [this discussion](%g3hPVPDEO1Aj/uPl0+J2NlhFB2bbFLIHlty+YuqFZ3w=.sha256) for background, but the gist is that colons only have a special meaning if you have a host:\n\n![URI syntax railroad diagram](&2ryLxD30UPdioD68/y8e3bgGamDETzjjKjJ9Jd5f3tw=.sha256)\n\nURL parsers won't be able to handle it since it doesn't have a host, but any URI parser should be able to handle it just fine. The scheme should be parsed as `ssb` and the path should be parsed as `message:sha256:abcdef`. It's more similar to URI schemes like `mailto:`, `magnet:`, and `urn:` than URL schemes like `http://`. With that said, I'd still love to hear your thoughts if you think there are ways to improve the current scheme. âœ¨",
