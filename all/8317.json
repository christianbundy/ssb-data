It's pretty hacky, but I finally got something working and I wanted to share.\n\n![dat.png](&YRUbs22yDBK5p5hjA/gNghprkP8WcKGx+aQPrYgu45I=.sha256)\n\nI'm lazy and just used some HTML page I found, but if we used JSON instead then this would be rendered as an actual message. The branch is available [here](https://gitlab.com/christianbundy/ssb-blob-content/merge_requests/1/diffs) is anyone wants to check it out, but it's basically the same thing as #blob-content with Dat identifiers instead of blob hashes. Maybe we could build something cool on top of this?\n\nAssorted thoughts:\n\n- Could an entire Scuttlebutt feed be expressed under a Dat key?\n- I should probably make sure that this respects the 5 MB blob limit.\n- Should Dat updates be handled? How?\n- Does Dat work without an internet connection? Or does it need a DHT announce server?\n- Am I causing trouble by calling `dat.archive.readFile()` multiple times before the file is finished?",
