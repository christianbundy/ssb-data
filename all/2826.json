Matt wrote a tokenizer that goes from `MCSS -> JS Object -> CSS`, but since it's so easy to do operations on the token object (like diffs!) I just need to be able to turn it back into MCSS when I'm done.\n\nI've taken the diff between the light and dark themes and it's *mostly* perfect, but there are a few small issues with shorthand properties like `background` versus `background-image`that require some tweaking. On the upside, I was able to remove about 75% of the dark theme, so those theme files feel much more lightweight. I'll push some code to the branch `@christiabundy/diff-dark` on the Patchwork repo if you want to see where I'm at, but here's a tiny preview (perma-scuttling because I have Patchbay open):\n\n![screenshot of diff dark theme on Patchwork](&NBctYIy/QX+wuI53NhNBXW0yHYPgDcpoMlqicKDBCDg=.sha256)\n\n[@matt](@FbGoHeEcePDG3Evemrc+hm+S77cXKf8BRQgkYinJggg=.ed25519) \n\nWill do! I'll probably continue to play around with it and try to come up with a more elegant solution -- I'll reach out if it's ever clean enough to be reused!",
