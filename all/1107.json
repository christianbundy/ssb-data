It looks like Patchbay is just creating an `<iframe>` to embed the raw text file, and the browser running under the hood, Chromium is auto-encoding the browser to what I *think* is [Western](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1). Firefox is doing the same for me.\n\nYou can resolve this issue with a [BOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) to force the browser (or SSB client) to use the correct character encoding. Which text editor are you using? In Vim, for example, you can use `:set bomb` to ensure that the file is saved with a BOM.\n\nFor example, here's your file with a BOM: &vNyMLlGhTjfSuTtdWLD3cz4+pd6OS3RYFCm+zk1BszM=.sha256",
