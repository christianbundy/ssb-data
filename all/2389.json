Could you try running `electron index.js` to see it's just an(other) issue with `node_modules/.bin/electron`? I know that the version of Electron in the Arch repos has a handful of patches, so I wonder whether there's a bugfix in there somewhere that's resolving the hang for me.\n\nI've gotta run, but later on I can check and see `npm start` causes hangs under X. At this point I have no trust in the Electron NPM module.",
