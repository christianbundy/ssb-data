I imagine you own a house? I'm [currently] stuck with apartment living, but I'm *really* looking forward to managing some of my own needs rather than outsourcing everything to property \"\"\"management\"\"\".\n\n[@ibob](@vkdMlsuBgzzo5eLS3LZLdqnBpZ26OauJOMIq9gQ2E7E=.ed25519)\n\nI've never had (or made) white sweet tea -- anything I should know, or should I just dive in feet first?\n\n[@kas](@dBQlwh9Gtr3i5YMOGtIOKtGNVepeu+nyb6KGl1vtOcM=.ed25519)\n\nSame as above except with oat milk, never tried it, but I should really experiment a bit more with non-dairy milk.

Natural non-animal fibers are often inexpensive and comfortable, but living in the Pacific Northwest (and doing volunteer search and rescue) in a predominantly wet area makes me hesitant to use cellulose fibers that are mostly hygroscopic. On the other hand, [some folks](http://woodtrekker.blogspot.com/2012/11/cotton-vs-wool-insulation.html#uds-search-results) are skeptical of wool's \"insulates even when wet\" property, although it's anti-odor properties are pretty clear IMO. I also found [a study from 1944](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/32/jresv32n5p229_A1b.pdf) with all sorts of fibers and fabrics, but I'm *sure* there's better science out there.",
