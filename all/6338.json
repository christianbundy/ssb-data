Now to take that damn test...\n\n[@joey](@BCM6DHYJvWzwWi1lFl2tjDXjaqyZAEmJH5ZONSpXhtc=.ed25519) I have a UV-5R that I use for search and rescue and it's *fine*, but I wish I'd gone with the UV-82. I'll probably buy one soon once the duct tape holding my UV-5R's battery starts to slip, but if you're buying one I'd recommend the UV-82.\n\n[@punkmonk](@EaYYQo5nAQRabB9nxAn5i2uiIZ665b90Qk2U/WHNVE8=.ed25519) No coursework, and at least in my city there are exams every few weeks put on by the local ham radio clubs. I bought a study guide after repeatedly failing practice tests at <https://hamexam.org>, but it turns out that my software knowledge doesn't translate well to electromagnetics. Figures. ",
