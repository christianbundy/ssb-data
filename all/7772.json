If it lasts for more than a few minutes, I'd recommend restarting Patchwork. Any chance Patchwork may be running in the background or something? Sometimes I'll get a frozen \"scuttling\" when it can't connect to the SSB server (because it's being used by another process).\n\nOnce it's finished scuttling you can copy and paste your feed ID (`@pMMUGwiEuuU1WKTQlby9SM/wkY4s0VKLqZ+P+Wmewpc=.ed25519`) into the search box and manually follow it from your wife's computer, and when they're on the same wifi they should definitely peer.\n\nHope that helps!",
