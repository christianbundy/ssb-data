There's no \"related channels\" feature (yet, though #somebody-should), but if you hit *More* at the top left you can browse all the channels, and if you're on the [latest version](%gsoWkvWuFLZxRC3ko9Ye7mHDKRs7cu3/85/lD7GvSyY=.sha256) there's a new tagging feature that might give you a better view of the network.\n\nI suppose when someone tags a post with two tags those are technically \"related\", but tag usage is still pretty low-volume. When I joined I just went to the channel browser in Patchwork and subscribed to a ton of channels. I *think* you could also go to someone's profile and see what they're subscribed to, but you know my memory is atrocious. :boom: ",
