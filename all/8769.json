Also we don't want to depend on that type because others could add similar messages, so we'd need another lookup mechanism (e.g. ensure `msg.value.author === \"@00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.ed25519\"`) anyway.\n\nThe errors are all \"Error replicating with @${X}: Error: parent stream is closing\" or \"Error: stream ended with:${Y} but wanted:${Z}\". It's possible that they're just your run-of-the-mill network errors on dropped connections and such, but they seemed to get worse after I've done deletion. \n\nI'll post an update once I'm at a good stopping place with the new code and be sure to cc you for feedback. Thank you!",
