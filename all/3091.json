    "text": "> Are there any tricks, or is it just shear will power?\n\nIt was much easier than I anticipated, but I found that it was easier to frame \"fasting\" as \"hydrating\". I'll usually have a 1 liter bottle of water within sight/reach, and any time I feel a bit hungry I'll just chug some water. It resolves the feeling of an empty stomach, plus it helps balance out my inability to remember to drink water like a normal human.\n\nOtherwise, I think it's just a matter of your body getting used to not being full of food all the time. It took about a month until I was comfortably fasting until noon, but now I can wake up at 06:00 and not feel a hunger pang until around 14:00.\n\n> Do you feel any benefits?\n\nMaybe a bit of extra focus in the morning, but with all of the marketing garbage about the benefits of fasting I'm pretty skeptical of the placebo effect. I only have three tangible benefits I can think of:\n\n- I've been drinking way more water in the mornings, which keeps me hydrated.\n- I used to get super hungry for breakfast, but now I don't feel those urgent \"I need to eat\" feelings unless I've been fasting for close to 24 hours.\n- The urge to snack between meals is basically non-existent, although when I'm feeling lazy my brain still thinks that chips and salsa is a fine alternative to a real dinner."
