I think your Ubuntu might be too old to support Patchwork. I tried looking up Ubuntu 13 but I can't find the package list, could you maybe try updating to one of the supported Ubuntu LTS versions? Ubuntu 14 is a bit outdated but would *probably* be supported, but if you could make the jump to 16/18 that would be ideal. ",
