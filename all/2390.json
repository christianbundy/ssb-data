That was obviously dangerous.\n2. That's definitely not what thumbs are supposed to look like.\n3. I haven't actually looked at it but I *definitely* don't need stitches.\n\n[@nanomonkey](@+D0ku/LReK6kqd3PSrcVCfbLYbDtTmS4Bd21rqhpYNA=.ed25519) \n\nYou caught me! Going to Zoo Care is so much cheaper than going to a human doctor, just like buying [fish antibiotics](https://mashable.com/2017/08/06/fish-antibiotics-america-healthcare/) instead of going to the pharmacist. :wink: \n\nFor real though, it's a place called [ZOOM+Care](https://www.zoomcare.com/) up the street that has cheap(ish) and easy appointments so you don't have to go to urgent care. It's great for little things where urgent care is overkill but you don't want to wait for a conventional doctor's appointment. Most appointments are 15 minutes, but for little stuff like this they have 1-hour time slots as well. It feels a bit too \"we have an app so lazy millenials love us\" but I've found it to be a fine tradeoff between price and convenience.",
