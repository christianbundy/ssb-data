For example, lots of the depject-imported code in Patchbay actually comes from [patchcore](https://github.com/ssbc/patchcore), which is a collection of depject modules that are used by multiple clients. For example, `message.html.render` actually comes from [here](https://github.com/ssbc/patchcore/tree/master/message/html/render), which is understandably confusing.\n\nIIRC depject modules are considered deprecated in Patchwork, and I'll admit I avoid depject whenever I can, but they're *at least* important to be able to hack around when you're trying to figure something out. \n\nFor example, `keys.sync.id` comes from [this file](https://github.com/ssbc/patchcore/blob/632f74ad8a65960017ff438eaf47b2e90ccd7cc8/keys.js) in patchcore, which seems to be a layer of abstraction over ssb-keys. \n\nLet me know if I can help with anything else! I used to struggle with depject. I still do, but I used to too. :wink: ",
