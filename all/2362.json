    "text": "Wow, this was really special to see -- I really appreciate the kind words, gif, poem, and even nose-typing martyrodm. It turns out that while typing on my laptop is near-impossible, my office keyboard is decently ergonomic and lets me type in a comfortable position (albeit much slower). My words-per-minute will be significantly lower, but constrained writing is at least an interesting puzzle. Some of my favorite forms of constrained writing:\n\n- **English prime.** This constraint disallows all forms of \"to be\" \n- **Lipogram.** No usage of certain letters, for example:\n  - https://oulipo.social outlaws all fifth symbols in your posts\n  - https://dolphin.town eeee eeee eeeeeeeee eeeeeeee eeee ee eeeeeeeeee\n- **Pilish.** Now I have a limit, orneriest pi.\n\nAlso, because sharing mistakes is important: glass is sharp and fragile, don't push on it! In hindsight my mistake was predictable, but after reading through %7F3o2CBenjEHmrP06jcsnhOMWMmfO8wZRvszmJBjXJM=.sha256 I decided to make myself some gunpowder green tea and took out my french press.\n\n![side profile of french press](&xI33lhYc3cuv4nmufmBj7LzWXPflMGh5RW3NAKPVPOI=.sha256)\n\nI was *so* sure that the black plastic bit was supposed to come off for deep cleaning, and after a bit of pushing I decided that the safest way to separate them would be to push the glass upward from the bottom with my thumb. This has made a ~lot of people very angry~ me very bloody and been widely regarded as a bad move.\n\n![bottom view of french press](&MzPx64918NExZGuHe9VL79cqCO37UMszP6MCkX7mxtM=.sha256)\n\nI stopped the bleeding with a nearby towel and my (lovely) girlfriend Kathleen grabbed my first aid kit so that we could apply some gauze. At one of my search and rescue trainings I heard a joke that there are four ways to stop bleeding:\n\n1. Compression\n2. Compression\n3. Compression\n4. Tourniquet!\n\nI only had to apply methods 1-3, but when I went to change the dressing a few hours later it started bleeding the same as before, so I collected all of my insurance information (yay US healthcare) and went to the doctor. It was my first time getting stitches but I'd like to think we all had a good time.\n\n![friendly doctor laughing maniacally](&+ivCjSUGQBVI9SjGE1SPUdh0Z20cIoxhe0gnXoacfgE=.sha256)\n\n![me very happy after getting stitches](&TPw8Tdk6+GsM9MgS2Ob1x1hlnRjDEZxLO7TbpYnAvyQ=.sha256)\n\nFor those with a morbid curiosity, I took some [gross] photos [during](&kE6qXbB3D3YBo7bH5ezaD+T6UTiDnYEWTaXZUIPx5Pc=.sha256) and [after](&F/SvBZNnOx/KTuqEuoMJ6agFND5eYszkmfeNGfKTJdo=.sha256). Seven sutures total, although I'm *still* pretty sure that some super glue would've been fine-ish. It turns out that thumbs are pretty useful, so I'm excited to get back to normal use as quickly as possible.\n\nUntil then, I'll likely be Ergodox-only. \n\n![my hand and bandage with ergodox after stitches](&X3T+z1w5lchIgeLWOg7tQq29P0HvrpgtU03JkEw75Os=.sha256)\n\nOn the upside, I asked the doctor whether I would have a sweet scar and he said \"sure\", which sounds like a very professional and accurate prognosis. On other other hand, after telling me about how hard it is to push needles through skin (he compared it to leather), he told me that mine wasn't that thick, which is actually the first time I've been told I have thin skin. ðŸ™ƒ",
