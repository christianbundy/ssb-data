Here's what I know:\n\n- the post is greater than 3 months old\n- the post originated from one of substack's accounts\n- the post contained a blob\n- my like happened less than 1 month ago\n\nIt'd be trivial to use Patchbay's `/query` page to find all of my likes, and I'm sure I could filter by date, but I'm unclear on applying filters to subject of my like. Is there a simple way to do this?",
