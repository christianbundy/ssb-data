I get all sorts of \"ThreadCard could not fetch\" messages, but I think they're just warnings coming from /posts rather than /public. Could you post which version of Patchbay you're running right now and how it's installed? I know you and I both have had a few issues where `package.json` isn't being updated correctly downstream, so whenever I have a bug my first inclination is `npm update` just in case.",
