I think alt-nets have the benefit of leaving no trace, but I'm not sure what other pros or cons there are. It's a very clever idea though! You could send a private message where you both agree to a network key and then switch over to that channel, similar to how on the radio you move conversations from well-known channels to other frequencies.\n\nAfter I've thought about it for a minute, couldn't you stack encrypted groups on top of an alt-net? You'd send a private message saying \"switch to network key X\" and then you'd post an encrypted group message on that network key and share the secret with your contact. It's like #offchain-content but instead we just move it to a *different* chain that's private.\n\n...and if we have a different chain, wouldn't that be a super simple way to do multi-feed identities? You'd have one root identity on the main network posting #same-as messages where you share the other network key(s) you're using. We'd use the same public key, so I think this could *just work* without many changes to existing clients. There are only two footguns I can think of:\n\n- You're sharing the same private key across devices, which means it's more likely to be stolen.\n- If your private key is stolen you may not know about it because your ssb-server/sbot doesn't check that network key.\n- Some clients may have issues if they assume that each feed has a single sequence number (?!)",
