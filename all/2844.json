My original goal was to create a platform for cryptography tools (like a Bitcoin wallet generator) that wouldn't actually use any local storage, but I suppose you could encrypt the storage with a key (maybe passed via a query parameter?). I suppose you probably don't want your private key in your web history, but the only alternative I can think of is manually copy and pasting your key each time you load the app. That sucks too.",
