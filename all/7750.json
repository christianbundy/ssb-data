Here are some similar tools I can think of:\n\n- Task Manager from Windows\n- Activity Monitor from macOS\n- System Monitor from GNOME\n- Inspect Element/Developer Tools from browsers\n- Django Admin (%3uZZQ2Ht6KAHpgoHaKGYht7wrRPClMVFjdawESvnyVA=.sha256)\n- phpmyadmin\n- [feedpunk](%ETdUKqd+6Ei8ayj1bRWhITl4G2KeVwf+8RhGhdo62s8=.sha256) \n\nDo you think something like \"SSB Monitor\" is intuitive, or are admin/monitor/etc just something I'm used to which makes it feel more neutral than it is? As we continue nailing down SSB bugs I think it will become increasingly important to have debugging tools that anyone can use, and I think starting out with a non-terrible name is probably a good call. I'd be super interested to hear your thoughts on this if you have time. âœ¨ ",
