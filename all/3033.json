With that said, I've got a fine setup going so far:\n\n- Email: FastMail\n- Contacts: FastMail\n- Calendar: FastMail\n- OSM: Maps.me and OSMAnd+\n- Term: None, I've just been doing my computing on my laptop.\n- Other: I use (and love!) Syncthing and can't recommend it enough. I'm running a Raspberry Pi connected to a 1 TB hard drive and I have all of my photos and videos auto-synced as soon as I take them."
