I'll plan on bringing a hammock and cross the transportation/bedding bridge when we cross it.\n\nI'll wait to hear more next week (or whenever you have time) on food costs and such, no rush there. To be explicit, my only bias on food is that I'd love to have a vegan option. I've had a handful of experiences at vegetarian-friendly spots where every option has lots of eggs/dairy/etc., so I just wanted to make sure that I can bring my own food if that's the case.\n\nAnyway, if there's anything I can do to help facilitate please let me know. I'm super pumped, can't wait to be there!",
