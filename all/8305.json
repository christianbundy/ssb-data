I'm not sure, I was on social.coop before things sort of imploded.\n\nI really love your grocery wagon, I don't think I've ever seen panniers like yours -- they remind me of the cargo net you often see in the back of some hatchback vehicles, I bet they're super convenient. I can already tell you'll be popular in #cats. Looking forward to getting to know you!",
