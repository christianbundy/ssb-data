    "text": "Hi [@Isla](@VfMNCgXMC5t6zJP2JAJKjGbQ37/XxcWFyOWQEsQbtI0=.ed25519).\n\nI wish I had a solid solution but it's hard to know with these sorts of things. I've found that the things that help the most are *often* the most difficult when I'm feeling down -- for me that's usually:\n\n- strenuous exercise\n- spending time with people I'm close with\n- giving myself things to look forward to (like a friend hangout next week)\n- avoiding mindless websites (mostly reddit)\n- therapy, medication, or both\n\nUsually when I'm feeling down I won't have the energy for those, so instead I'll take a tiny action that has the same spirit but way lower magnitude:\n\n- stretching or taking a short walk\n- sending a text to someone I'm close with\n- giving myself something small to look forward to (like video games at 6 PM)\n- reading *only* the first page of a mindless website\n- telling someone I'm close with about how I'm feeling\n\nMy experience with depression is that it often comes in waves, and that after spending some time coping (whether that's watching a movie or staring at the ceiling) I'll often have *just enough* energy to gently push myself to do one of the above. Using those moments to build healthier habits has been one of the few footholds I've found to get out of depression, but I've had a few times where that didn't work and I used medication to make the process go smoother.\n\nAre there things that make you feel better after you finish Melancholia? Depression sucks but it *can* suck less over time. Thanks for starting this thread.\n\n![hermoji: small hermes hearts gif](&/iR2Wkd0XJT22GOym8MiUig5QBh1tYwTrmqpYyhGUFE=.sha256)",
