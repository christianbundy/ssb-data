My understanding was that different feed types are meant to solve the problem of [different signature algorithms](%pFMhPDi7AcL9o935hc304J4hmfoQAGjQHS0Wt7/MB+4=.sha256), whereas this upgrade would only:\n\n- add message content to the replication stream\n- use a different string suffix in `msg.value.content`\n\nI'm sure we'll talk about this more on the protocol call tomorrow, but I think I'm looking for clarity on whether *all* upgrades need their own feed type or whether a new feed type is a prerequisite for one/both of the above. Really appreciate the feedback, I'm excited to get off-chain content implemented and it's important to me that we do things The Right Way.\n\nðŸš€",
