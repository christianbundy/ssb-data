    "text": "My name is Christian and I'm not completely convinced that all of this is real.\n\nI had my first bout of \"I don't care about reality I'd rather be dead\" throughout my teens and early twenties which was ~~cured~~ altered by a powerful (and psychologically distressing) experience with psychedelics that was _mostly_ just a six-hour anxiety attack with a dash of \"you are the universe and consciousness is universal\" woo.\n\nI [wasn't myself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinogen_persisting_perception_disorder) for a few months while I slowly re-integrated into our shared reality, but it felt like someone had hit the reset button on my brain and I was finally able to see the world without the biases that I had learned regarding what was \"normal\".\n\nMost of my depression and anxiety are now focused around the incredibly boring dystopia that we're living in, plus a general feeling of uselessness in trying to dismantle \"too big to fail\" systems that hurt people (humans, non-human animals, and future generations).\n\nSometimes I get the nagging feeling that none of this is real or anxiety that I'm going to have my first [non-drug-induced] break with our shared reality, but generally thinking about the fact that _this is real for most people_ helps me push away my bullshit and try to think, talk about, and work on systems that make reality better for most people.\n\nSelf-medication:\n\n- Cannabis, though my usage has fluctuated a lot over the years (and sometimes this causes _more_ anxiety rather than less).\n- Walks, exercise, and all the stuff you know you _should_ do.\n- Veganism, which helped me feel less _personally_ responsible for animal agriculture.\n- Meditation if I ever remember to do it (can't recommend Alan Watts enough).\n- Friends (including my girlfriend) who somehow always have my back.\n- Getting the hell off of centralized/proprietary social media.\n- Talking about my problems and/or writing them down.\n- Cooperating, volunteering (mostly #SAR), and and raging against the machine.",
