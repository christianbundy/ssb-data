Could you unpack that idea a bit?\n\nMy brain jumped to technologies like Dat, IPFS, BitTorrent, and other data-centric software that would benefit from #offchain-content, but I get the feeling you're talking more about the *shape* of these applications rather than just throwing out techy buzzwords that have to do with blobs and data.",
