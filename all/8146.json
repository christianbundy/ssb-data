Also, the name is awful but it's good enough for today.\n> \n> P.S. Sorry about how messy this is. I swear I'll clean it up. Maybe.\n\nAlso, since we can address each piece of data by its content, we have no need for the authority section of the URL. Instead, we just append the URI to the path like:\n\nhttp://localhost/ssb:message:sha256:g3hPVPDEO1Aj_uPl0-J2NlhFB2bbFLIHlty-YuqFZ3w=\n\nor\n\nhttp://localhost/magnet:?xt=urn:btih:c12fe1c06bba254a9dc9f519b335aa7c1367a88a \n\nor\n\nhttp://localhost/patchlite:mentions\n\n:tada:",
