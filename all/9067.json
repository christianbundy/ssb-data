    "text": "> automatically clickable dat link formatting in SSB clients, without having to know about the ![]( dat:// ) or < dat:// > hacks\n\nJust wanted to comment while I'm thinking of this: The `<href>` syntax should work everywhere, but unfortunately [Dat links aren't URIs](https://github.com/datproject/dat/issues/1050) so auto-linkifiers don't work without lots of jank. You can do dat://example.com for actual domains, but if it's a hash it won't work because it's 64 characters (and domain segments have a maximum of 63 characters). I wish we could fix it, but I think it's a standards compliance issue on Dat's side. :/"
