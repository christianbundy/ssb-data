I noticed that when your profile photo is scaled down that the interpolation turns the jagged lines into gradients, and I was *so sure* that I could see a rabbit face when I saw a thumbnail of your profile photo. I thought you'd drawn a photo of a rabbit face, reverse-engineered the interpolation, and posted a profile photo that looked random unless it was scaled down and interpolated. \n\nI think I might be guilty of overthinking sometimes...
