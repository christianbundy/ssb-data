Here's my current approach:\n\n- Tab 1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory\n- Tab 2: http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/MATH1901/r/PDF/cheat-sheet.pdf\n\nI was thinking about how you could add some interesting dimensionality to tools like Anki by establishing logic between ideas in a topic, but I'm not sure whether that's actually a helpful abstraction. I'd like to play around with the idea and see if it takes me anywhere, but I think getting familiar with the notation is a reasonable first step."
