I'm currently maintaining three Arch packages:\n\n- [ssb-patchwork](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ssb-patchwork/): started by dlandau and [@pypper](@RBhUyyc4RfUSB8D4Vxz5zG0/8+tPaEjwyL33rM1R538=.ed25519), not sure whether they're active anymore but I've been maintaining since around April\n- [ssb-patchwork-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ssb-patchwork-git/): bleeding-edge fork of ssb-patchwork\n- [patchbay-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/patchbay-git/): bleeding-edge patchbay\n\nMy goal is to publish a non-Git version of Patchbay, but that requires a tag/release. I'll work on setting up some builders. In the meantime, maybe we can bikeshed which version number to release next? ðŸ¤”",
