I wasn't very involved in the creation of the pizza, but from what I remember:\n\n- basic pizza dough, we've used [this recipe](https://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/vegan-pizza-dough-10579#activity-feed) before\n- stir-fry some onions, peppers, mushrooms, and chickpeas\n- shmear some BBQ sauce on the dough\n- toss the veggies on top\n- bake and sprinkle some nutritional yeast on top\n\nThe veggies were seasoned but I'm not sure how. Maybe chili powder, smoked paprike, garlic, and crushed red pepper? Probably more info than you were looking for, but that's all I know!",
