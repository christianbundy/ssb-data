We are posting and hosting content that's likely under copyright with no simple method of removal.\n2. Our content is being downloaded, indexed, and cached by people who aren't our friends.\n\nAre there any options that resolve both of the above problems? I think it's important that we don't focus on trying to find a problem that can be solved with our favorite hammer."
