I really appreciate all the work you've been doing and I'd like to help however I can. With that said: there are *absolutely* accessibility issues with the current codebase, although I'm hesitant to name them because I'd love to chat with you more and see where the pain points are for you before I name them.\n\nOn the other hand, I've posted about them before, so maybe you've already seen some of the monsters. ðŸ˜±\n\nAnyway, lots of solidarity -- the codebase (and JavaScript in general) can be pretty adversarial, and I don't blame you at all for being frustrated. I've also been wanting to spend some time looking at the Rust and Go implementations, maybe that would be worth checking out together?",
