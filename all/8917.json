Message deleted, undo doesn't work, I can't find it in memory, and I don't expect to get it back. What a bummer, especially since the two buttons are *so close together*.\n\nMaybe #somebodyshould make an \"are you sure\" dialog when a post is above a certain length? I'm surprised that even Ctrl+Z didn't work, it's like the message was deleted and the `<textarea>` was banished to `/dev/null`.\n\nðŸ˜”",
