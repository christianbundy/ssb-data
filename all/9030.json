In an effort to get a mostly reasonable default across most operations systems, here's what I've been using lately:\n\n```css\nbody {\n  font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \"Segoe UI\", \"Roboto\", \"Oxygen\", \"Ubuntu\", \"Cantarell\", \"Fira Sans\", \"Droid Sans\", \"Helvetica Neue\", sans-serif;\n}\n```\n\nThis takes up a small amount of bandwidth, but it's negligible compared to the usual practice where the browser has to download a bunch of custom fonts just to avoid [looking ugly](http://www.motherfuckingwebsite.com/). I'm really looking forward to just declaring `font-family: system-ui` and avoiding the problem entirely!",
