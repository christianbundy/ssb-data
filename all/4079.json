    "text": "> Sorry for disrupting your thread\n\nNever! Linear discussion is rarely any fun, and borders are always worth criticizing.\n\nI'm currently living in a city with around 700,000 people (closer to 2.5 million if you count the metro sprawl) and wondering whether at this point it's too far gone. I'm lucky that I'm sure I *could* escape to a less-urban area, but it seems like that's a luxury most people don't have. That makes me want to stay and help make the city a better place for everyone, but I sometimes wonder whether that's just another way to get trapped here.\n\nI have some criticisms of [this bit from *My Dinner With Andre*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68JLWyPxt7g), but some of the points are thought-provoking."
