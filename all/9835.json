I'm super excited at this idea. Do you have thoughts on how to organize something like this? Most of the SSBC currently runs on [the advice process](http://reinventingorganizationswiki.com/Decision_Making) and I'm not sure how to extend that to a larger group focused on a longer time horizon.\n\n> Also I would like to point out that perhaps itâ€™s not so much a binary can code/canâ€™t code, but more so a spectrum of different peoples at different learning curves and curiosities.\n\nThanks for pointing this out, it's so easy to think \"everything is a spectrum\" but then apply binary thinking without even realizing it!\n\nMy current thought is just to host a regularly scheduled open call to discuss Patchwork and its future, but I'm a bit concerned that it'll be prone to:\n\n- drive-by opinions / too many cooks in the kitchen\n- [inclusivity problems](%tKTXjWcMlo0U4GO/YPoSgkHaBjihm6ZoXnmEssZy7cs=.sha256)\n- [tyranny of whoever showed up](%whA4JgjxhxEMG/+8vFCS5+enDxj8mgm4H+zeNqw9QBI=.sha256)\n\nAnother alternative would be to only invite trusted friends , but that seems like it could have the same inclusivity problems *plus* a risk of real or perceived cronyism / in-group favoritism. I'd be super appreciative if you have thoughts on how to organize this, and / or please let me know if I'm prematurely optimizing this. ðŸ˜¬",
