Do you think comments would show up as [Post Title (%cAq)](%cAqSYKmIBjrNrM4Im18yYukD6KsOMni5IIWLOWwtY7A=.sha256) or something? I like how GitHub does [foo/bar#123](#) but I'm not sure we have any guarantees about linearity.\n\n[@dominic](@EMovhfIrFk4NihAKnRNhrfRaqIhBv1Wj8pTxJNgvCCY=.ed25519) I swear I always find out about cool packages *way* after I've implemented a crappy prototype version of them. Thanks! Is this still in use for TickTack? I've never used/installed it. :sweat_smile: \n\n[@kas](@dBQlwh9Gtr3i5YMOGtIOKtGNVepeu+nyb6KGl1vtOcM=.ed25519) Yeah, Patchbay had `h2` elements that were smaller than `h3` elements for a while, but after fixing it I'm *so* happy. I was always so reluctant to use `##` or `###` because of it. I wonder how silly my `h1` post titles look in Patchfoo.",
