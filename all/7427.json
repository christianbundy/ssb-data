    "text": "Same! I felt really refreshed afterward, it was really great to audio-meet those of you I haven't spoken with before.\n\nAlso seconding the recommendation for Plumble, my audio hardware is constantly fighting my kernel (and losing), so I often do audio input/output on my phone. Enabling PTT was easy, although I'd recommend turning off the TTS unless you like hearing \"waaaaaahoohh DEE\" when someone types \"wooooah :D\"."
