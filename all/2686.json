    "text": "I completely agree that this doesn't update us, but from an mobility/agility standpoint I'm not super excited about dependencies with no reachable maintainer. \nFor the record, I'm not crazy about `npm audit` either, but it seems helpful to be able to contribute back to upstream repositories when we notice a warning light is on (great metaphor).\n\nIt looks like @yoshuawuyts is a collaborator on the repo, maybe we could ping them on GH?\n"
