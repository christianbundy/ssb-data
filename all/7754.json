    "text": "# Pants\n\nCan I just rant about pants for a second? I strongly believe that they have room for improvement. Let's start from the top.\n\n## Waist\n\nFirst off, belts should just be part of the pants, and they should obviously be adjustable. Belts should never slip above your waistband when you sit down, and the number of belt loops that would resolve that problem would look so silly that you may as well sew it into the pants. I've seen adjustable waistbands done well in [tactical pants](https://images-dynamic-arcteryx.imgix.net/details/1350x1710/Assault-Pant-AR-MultiCam-Waist.jpg?auto=format&w=1350) and utility overalls, but I think they could look reasonable in some daily drivers.\n\nSecondly, can we please size pants based on rise of the pants and the diameter of the top opening? None of this \"estimated waist size\" nonsense. People should literally be able to look at your spec sheet, spend 2 minutes with some measuring tape, and have an accurate picture of whether your clothes are going to fit them well. Don't even get me started on \"medium\". When it comes to tops I'm always \"small\", \"medium\", or \"large\", which really doesn't narrow it down very much. I don't know why I feel so strongly about this.\n\n## Knees\n\nComputer-generated graphics tend to improve over time for many reasons, but the number of vertices on each polygon is a good proxy for how well it fits the intended silhouette. Unfortunately, people who make pants tend to assume that legs are cylinders that don't bend, and that straight seams are probably going to be fine. Again, [more tactical pants](https://www.lockharttactical.com/media/com_hikashop/upload/610t_007_knee.jpg) to the rescue, but of course most of them make you look like a mall ninja.\n\n## Taper\n\nI have a hard time understanding this one, because I think it would save manufacturers a bit of money, but *human legs tend to have a natural taper*. My favorite example of this are [Strongworks](https://shop.outlier.nyc/shop/retail/strongworks.html), which are otherwise a great pair of pants, except I have to pinroll them every day because the ankle is almost the same size as the thigh. Why? \n\n## Repair\n\nI get that manufacturers probably want people to buy more pants, but when my pants start to fall apart I'd really like to be able to repair them myself. I'd be way more likely to buy a pair of pants that included a diagram of their construction or a link to buy cuts of the fabric so that I can sew them on myself. Patches and \"not too noticeable\" seams are fine for work pants, but when it's a nice pair of pants or your onlly pair of pants it's really nice to be able to make them look like new again. Anyway, that's my rant.\n\n---\n\n**TL;DR:** I really want to try making pants because I'm sure it's way harder than I think it is."
