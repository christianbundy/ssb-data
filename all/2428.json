    "text": "I hadn't really thought of that, but beer *does* seem to lack some liquidity because of how personal it is. I was thinking that instead of passing it on, we can treat the beer as fungible and you could also send a beer to someone else (say, Alice). In that case, there are three scenarios:\n\n- Alice meets up with you and you buy her a beer. She \"gifts\" you back a beer and now you're even. No debt, just gifts until you become even. :heavy_plus_sign: \n- Alice meets up with me and I buy her a beer. She \"gifts\" me a beer and now we're *all* even, as we've formed a triangle.\n- Alice gifts a beer to someone else, and the cycle continues recursively until our balances are settled.\n\nWith this system you'd never cancel out a gift or mark it as \"redeemed\", but instead you calculate your relative balance with others on the network and try to find settlement pathways."
