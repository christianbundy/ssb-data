I think Kathleen got it from her mom (?) and we've just been using it like a baking pan, but it's good to know that we should be leaving it in the oven.\n\nThe idea of leaving the oven on for an hour makes me feel a wasteful, but once we're deeper into fall/winter I'm sure I won't mind the extra heat. How do you take the pizza out of the oven without the stone? I'm hoping you don't tell me I need one of those big wooden paddle/spatula things... ",
