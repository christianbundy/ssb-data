Put a [clingy](%ZHIOCobHeQkEM3+Q5pc4qvuOInQjTkewYiRKDVjr67A=.sha256) pub on a Raspberry Pi.\n2. Hook up a wireless router to the Pi and configure a [captive portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_portal) with SSB installers.\n3. Put up some posters with network details and some interesting prompt.\n\nI can think of a few problems but I think it might be a fun experiment to provide an way to connect with neighbors in local cypherspace. **I'd love suggestions on how to improve this idea, suggestions for interesting prompts, or both!**\n\nObligatory: you're right, it'd probably be better to meet them afk, but there are four (!) apartment buildings next to me and I've only really met people from my floor. Plus I like the idea of having something like [Nextdoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nextdoor) collectively hosted by the community.",
