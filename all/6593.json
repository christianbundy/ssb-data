    "text": "> If you check `uname -a` you get the Arch version, while I think the Antergos AUR pkg has a version too.\n\n```console\n$ uname -a\nLinux samus 4.18.14-arch1-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Sat Oct 13 13:42:37 UTC 2018 x86_64 GNU/Linux\n```\n\nCould you mean the [linux kernel](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/core/x86_64/linux/) version? If you're avoiding `pacman -Syu` then it might be a useful proxy for how behind your other packages are, but you can install new packages without upgrading your kernel.\n\n> I'm not sure what you mean about versions not mattering. \"Antergos does not support partial updates!\"\n\nI don't use Antergos, but you're right -- [partial upgrades are not supported](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_maintenance#Partial_upgrades_are_unsupported), as everyone is assumed to be up-to-date via `pacman -Syu`.\n\n> The concern is, if you need to install the software without it forcing a full system upgrade.\n\nThe \"full system upgrade\" is something that should happen regularly, and packages are built with the assumption that your system is up-to-date. If you get any errors during the installation process I'd be happy to hear about them, but Arch packages don't specify a version range for dependency compatibility. You can see the dependencies [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/patchbay), but the best way to test is to attempt an installation:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://aur.archlinux.org/patchbay.git\ncd patchbay\nmakepkg -si\n```\n\n---\n\nI think this might be getting a bit sidetracked from @mix's announcement, maybe we could start a new thread for this discussion about #archlinux?",
