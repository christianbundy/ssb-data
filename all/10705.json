Most people seem to get mortgages, but since I'm conflicted about [where I'd like to live](%eLCz5shOYq3LwIKAay7cPj3TSeTdpl3afKqfmzsXfZk=.sha256) it sounds like *a lot* to put myself hundreds and thousands of USD in debt to a financial institution.\n\nI've been excited about the idea of housing cooperatives and I've chatted with [@jordan](@6hwStvpVIQkziTyk2iK0o8lWSU1OdUXzvIl1SdXx6N4=.ed25519) about them for way too many hours, but I haven't had any first- or second-hand experience with them. I'd really appreciate thoughts / feedback on housing if anyone's got solutions they dig.",
