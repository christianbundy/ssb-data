If you have your old `secret` and `gossip.json` you *may* be able to get your old feed back:\n\n1. Move `~/.ssb` somewhere else for a bit, maybe `.ssb.bak`.\n2. Create a new `.ssb` directory.\n3. Copy your `secret` and `gossip.json` into that directory.\n4. Open a client (or run `sbot server`).\n\nIt'll reset your feed to how the rest of the network views your feed, so you'll lose those ~50 posts but you won't have to restart your identity. Welcome back!",
