One of my thoughts was showing gossip activity since it's [hard to debug](%M0Cveu/Kbl3yLG3gonrY2r1YCRCXvekMKRRXKbmxKek=.sha256), but it looks like [@mix](@ye+QM09iPcDJD6YvQYjoQc7sLF/IFhmNbEqgdzQo3lQ=.ed25519) may have [read my mind](%+U0LnC6hc8S607e7vgS2+6Icso7zlpgI27zBWM/Yii0=.sha256)!\n\n> what would prompt someone to want to look under the hood\n\nI think there are all sorts of low-level bugs that people experience (endless \"scuttling\", forked feeds, gossip failure) and maintenance tasks that people may want to do (e.g. delete a feed) that would be nice to handle in one application.\n\n> what sort of answer or insight (in the form of code or otherwise) would they expect to find\n\nI'm thinking something like:\n\n- list of all of the feeds in your database\n  - add raw data to your feed\n  - delete other feeds from your database\n  - follow, unfollow, or block feeds\n- list all of the blobs in your filesystem\n  - add blobs to the filesystem\n  - delete blobs from the filesystem\n  - get messages that reference blobs\n- list of all the peers in your `gossip.json`\n  - add peer to the gossip file\n  - delete peer from gossip file\n  - get real-time network activity, including errors and statistics\n  - get network history, including errors and statistics\n- make backups\n  - all of the above should be able to be backed up or restored from a backup\n  - possible #dark-crystal integration to shard password for backup (or just keypair)\n- list all flumedb views\n  - get indexing progress on each view\n  - get ETA until indexing is complete (and maybe statistics on progress)\n- create [benchmarks](%kuxL79vQ1f+ZqaIFu3srHRTov2xA0nX7MRC5cUCSwY8=.sha256) to see how the software performance changes over time\n\nI think a lot of the lower-level bits of Scuttlebutt can actually be pretty intuitive if people feel empowered to tinker and/or troubleshoot by themselves, and I don't think we have very much infrastructure for that right now.
