Is there a public host:port:key that you can share so I can try with 13.0.3?\n\n---\n\n[@alanz](@ZcjYF92reFjUtEYdoJ8ulOI6N6klwAAaIkghEEHdvSE=.ed25519) \n\nInteresting, I've also been using `/public` to test whether messages are coming in. Have you been doing the scrolling trick? I don't remember where I learned it, but sometimes you'll need to scroll up and down in Patchbay to get new posts to show up in the feed. I think it's meant to keep posts from jumping around while you're reading, but it might benefit from a \"new posts above, scroll up!\" message as well.",
