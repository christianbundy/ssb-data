It's less private because you're sharing your IP address, but for people who are comfortable sharing their IP addresses with the world it's going to give the best possible connectivity. We would still group people by their Scuttlebutt network key, but otherwise you'd have one big swarm where we could all connect to each other.\n\nI've mentioned this before in the context of discovery-swarm, but maybe it would work with ssb-rooms too? I'm unclear on how much ssb-rooms are coupled with specific servers.",
