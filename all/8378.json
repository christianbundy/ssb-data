The value of  `/over/the/rainbow` is dynamic and expected to change, but `sha1:ef2004b8783a49886b109ecf8943bff8b24ae7b7` will always refer to the exact same value. In this model, periods would be analogous to slashes, since they refer to an address rather than the value itself. Would that make sense for most cases, or is aiming for sanity completely futile?",
