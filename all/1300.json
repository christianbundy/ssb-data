I'm not sure how to do it, but I'm *hoping* these new systems and tools start to appear as we decentralize the distribution of information in more equitable ways. Fingers crossed.\n\n[@MistyWrites](@pywb9JjJUwlMJBb33nc5fOCACbH6gN1U6O39E7uqrv8=.ed25519)\n\nI think what [@greg](@JoiN9c9+xO0jgu0gg5yflTf+L1peLTBneFHjrKbmcKo=.ed25519) said sums up my views as well: sincere recommendations and offers are important cornerstones in society. I love to see \"advertisements\" about new SSB features, new work from my friends, recipes, or even self-promotion from my peers. I think \"bullshit\" and \"patter\" are great ways to classify the types of ads I'm criticizing, but I've *personally* never seen anything of the sort on SSB.",
