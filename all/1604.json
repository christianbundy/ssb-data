    "text": "> That's just cats in a nutshell, isn't it?\n\nAbsolutely. I love dogs too, but *really* as long as I'm not considered dinner I've felt similarly with most non-human animals. Humans, though... much harder to love unconditionally!\n\nZapper looks adorable, and I imagine he's *loving* his bed in that photo, regardless of the flash. I have a long-running theory that cats think (know?) that they're better than humans, which makes their \"why is my human interrupting me\" faces so much funnier. The way you talk about him makes it clear that he had a really great friend. I'd never like to lose another animal, but I take peace in the fact that none of my animal friends have ever had to lose me. It's *way* too early in the day to be tearing up over the thought of losing animals, but I read this a few years ago and I thought it was special (albeit silly, and from Tumblr):\n\n> In the dog world, humans are elves that routinely live to be 500+ years old.\n\n>“They live so long…but the good ones still bond with us for our entire lives.” \n\n>“These immortals are so kind we must be good friends to them”\n\n>“Now I am old. The fur around my muzzle is grey and my joints ache when we walk together. Yet she remains unchanged, her hair still glossy, her skin still fresh, her step still sprightly. Time doesn’t touch her and yet I love her still.”\n\n>“For generations, he has guarded over my family. Since the days of my great-great-great-great-great-grandfather he has kept us safe. For so long we thought him immortal. But now I see differently, for just as my fur grows gray and my joints grow stiff, so too do his. He did not take in my children, but gave them away to his. I will be the last that he cares for. My only hope is that I am able to last until his final moments. The death of one of his kind is so rare. The ending of a life so long is such a tragedy. He has seen so much, he knows so much. I know he takes comfort in my presence. I only wish that I will be able to give him this comfort until the end.”\n\nMy parents always had cats and dogs, but when I moved out I didn't even think to adopt one myself until my girlfriend Kathleen and I moved in together. She has an 11-year-old cat named Sunshine, and we got Jerome last year from the shelter when he was only ~2 months old. He was pretty sick and had just spent 30 days in a quarantine for a fungal infection, but now he's a huge healthy boy who loves to cuddle. Unfortunately he didn't learn any social skills in quarantine, so he doesn't get along well with Sunshine, but we make do. This photo doesn't do him justice, but this is him on a full-size grocery bag.\n\n![jerome the huge cat on a grocery bag](&BB2W4eDUQcflLQAterEr/kiL5YMmbTquXuSKbzokJ/k=.sha256)",
