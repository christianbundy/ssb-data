For what it's worth, my branch of ssb-markdown is [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/) plus:\n\n- **Block**: Full HTML output, accepts Markdown string and `opts`.\n  - Any link starting with `#` has `target=\"_blank\"` added as a property.\n  - Emoji `:name:` renderer, defaults to UTF-8 emoji output but can use images with `opts.emoji` function.  \n  - Linkifier:\n    - HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, data, and dat URI schemes by default.\n    - Ability for plugins to add HTTP-like protocol handlers in `opts.protocols` array.\n    - Sigil links, hashtags, and @mentions rendered with `opts.toUrl()` function.\n  - Media:\n    - Supports alt text starting with `audio:` or `video:` to render media players.\n    - Wraps all imags in a link to that image with `opts.toUrl()` function (hmm).   \n- **Inline**: Plaintext content preview, accepts Markdown string and `opts`.\n  - Emoji `:name:` emojifier, defaults to UTF-8 emoji output but can use images with `opts.emoji` function.\n  - Links are replaced with the plaintext text node inside the link (no `href`).\n  - Images are replaced with their alt text.\n  - Code blocks are replaced with their HTML-encoded contents.\n\nIf you think the git object id linkifier might be a good fit for ssb-markdown I'd be happy to look into adding it to my branch.",
