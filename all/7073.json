    "description": "The potato (ðŸ¥”) is a starchy, tuberous crop from the perennial nightshade Solanum tuberosum. In many contexts, potato refers to the edible tuber, but it can also refer to the plant itself.[1] Common or slang terms include tater and spud. Potatoes were introduced to Europe in the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish. Today they are a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world's food supply. As of 2014, potatoes were the world's fourth-largest food crop after maize (corn), wheat, and rice.[2]\n\n## Irish Potato Famine\nThe Irish Potato Famine was a period of mass starvation, disease, and emigration in Ireland between 1845 and 1849, caused by potato blight. With the greatest impacted areas to the west and south of Ireland, where the Irish language was primarily spoken, the period was contemporaneously known as in Irish: An Drochshaol loosely translated as the hard-times (or literally, \"The Bad Life\"). The worst year of the period, that of \"Black 47\", is known as Irish: Bliain an Drochshaoil. During the famine, about one million people died and a million more emigrated from Ireland, causing the island's population to fall by between 20% and 25%.\n\nSharing much in common with the similar famines in India under British rule, the proximate cause of the famine was a natural event, a potato blight, which infected potato crops throughout Europe during the 1840s, precipitating some 100,000 deaths in total in the worst affected and similar tenant farmers of Europe, the food crisis was to influence much of the unrest in the more widespead European Revolutions of 1848.\n\n## References\n\n[1] [\"Potato - Definition of potato by Merriam-Webster\"](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/potato). merriam-webster.com.\n[2] [\"The potato sector\"](https://www.potatopro.com/world/potato-statistics).
