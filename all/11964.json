Boo. I looked around the web for other fermented beverages I could experiment with and found this weird \"ginger bug\" idea, and I was *so excited* to search SSB and find that your post was **already on my computer**. Scuttlebutt magic!\n\nI see you haven't been on in a few months, but if you have any thoughts from recent attempts. Especially:\n\n> I might try even preparing the the mix like this, stir it throughout the day, and then put it in a vessel, no bug. Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if that would work very well üëå\n\nThanks for posting this! I'm excited to try to make a ginger bug. ",
