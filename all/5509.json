I appreciate your help!\n\n[@mikey](@6ilZq3kN0F+dXFHAPjAwMm87JEb/VdB+LC9eIMW3sa0=.ed25519) \n\nI didn't know those were called continuables! I think callback-only functions are super useful, I think I even used them in my flume PR to handle `db.get()`. Sweet! I'll admit that some/many/most of the things in Fluture seem a bit over my head, are there any prerequisite resources you could recommend? Or, if \"just read the damn thing\" is the right course of action I'm happy to do that -- I might just be spoiled by the rest of the skimmable web.\n\nI love that I know those are called continuables though, I always want to call them \"curry callbacks\" but since it's not actually currying I'm hesitant to call it that. It looks like the run-waterfall function has a *slightly* different API (e.g. flume map functions accept `(value, callback)` but `callback` accepts `(error, value)`), but it looks like we're doing almost exactly the same thing. Thanks for linking that resource, it was helpful to see that someone else came up with a very similar solution.",
