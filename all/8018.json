Similar to [@zach](@ZqH7Mctu/7DNInxuwl12ECjfrAKUX2tBLq1rOldNhg0=.ed25519) I've *also* never been to anything with this format, so I've got some blurry uncertainties bouncing around in my head. Maybe you've all got some recommendations?\n\n## Transportation\n\nIt looks like public transportation goes almost everywhere (although [@rabble](@vzoU7/XuBB5B0xueC9NHFr9Q76VvPktD9GUkYgN9lAc=.ed25519) suggested a camper van), but I couldn't find any routes that stop near Riverslea. How are others planning on getting there? Is there a bus route that I've missed or would a scuttle carpool be appropriate?\n\n## Food\n\nAre we all bringing our own food, or pooling our cash and getting heaps of groceries to share? If we're planning to share (ðŸŽ‰), it sounds important to know what people can and want to eat. Also, [@kathleen](@GSuGLzJa8t3aJCLvs66Ekn7MXdr3yqCSzsd6z2iUEBY=.ed25519) and I love to cook and would be happy to help with food however we can.\n\n## Extra\n\nAnything extra I should bring, other than clothing and toiletries and such? I was thinking that a hammock and some straps might be fun, but since I'm unfamiliar with the space I wanted to ask. Sleeping bags? Or maybe I'm taking the word \"camp\" too literally.",
