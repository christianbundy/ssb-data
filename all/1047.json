That, *or* actual emoji versus `:emoji:`. ðŸ™ƒ\n\n[@dinosaur](@6ilZq3kN0F+dXFHAPjAwMm87JEb/VdB+LC9eIMW3sa0=.ed25519) \n\nThanks, that's a great thread. Just played around with it and everything seems to look reasonable. Again, I'm sure there will be bikeshedding, but after thinking about this a bit more I think we can just do a quick find and replace:\n\n- #x -> ssb://hashtag/x\n- @x ->  ssb://feed.ed25519/x\n- %x -> ssb://msg.sha256/x\n- &x -> ssb://blob.sha256/x\n\nFor example:\n\n- ssb://hashtag.ed25519/scuttlebutt\n- ssb://feed.ed25519/-oaWWDs8g73EZFUMfW37R_ULtFEjwKN_DczvdYihjbU=\n- ssb://msg.sha256/FvFRSvn-npJiXRbqUy4GqCFo2JnOaWtPxuRSnAL-ZqQ=\n- ssb://blob.sha256/5GEKOI_0YgTbK1WgGDQMHtWGJG6h2ferDw9D3PCDVbE=\n\nThis keeps the sigil at the front of the URL, allows us to update our algorithms in the future, and seems to be a valid URL. The only issue I can think of is when another `shsCap` is involved, but I imagine other networks might use something like `decent://` instead? Otherwise, this seems like it could save us a bunch of pain and suffering.\n\nHopefully we can eventually use [standardized hashtag identifier syntax](http://unicode.org/reports/tr31/#hashtag_identifiers) too! Our current implementation has a few interesting quirks.",
