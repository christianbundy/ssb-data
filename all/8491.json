For me, it's a question of whether you want to host content from people who have pub invites or whether you want one of your [human] friends to follow them before you want to host them.\n\nLots of my friends follow pubs and follow new users, so even though I don't follow pubs I'll still see lots of new folks, but *personally* I've found that the firehose of brand new users is a bit of a drain on my attention and sense of community. On the other hand, I started out as a rando with absolutely no scuttle-friends, so I appreciate that a real person ([@fabian](@k53z9zrXEsxytIE+38qaApl44ZJS68XvkepQ0fyJLdg=.ed25519)!) followed me, which would have introduced me to folks who don't follow pubs.",
