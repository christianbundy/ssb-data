If it's a public blob, then it already exists. You can run `sha256sum foo.png` to get the hash and then find it at `~/.ssb/blobs/sha256/`.\n3. You can attach any file, but it's only a \"security hole\" if you can get someone to run the file. This is the same scenario as the web, where anyone can upload a virus but nobody is forced to download or run it.\n\nWhich client are you using?",
