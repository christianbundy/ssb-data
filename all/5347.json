The basic idea:\n\n- each device running cjdns gets an IP address\n  - the IP address acts like a public key, so all network is end-to-end encrypted by default\n  - the IP address can only be used by other cjdns users, but anyone on the network can connect to you\n    - this means you don't need to get a web hosting company for a public IP address, since any cjdns user can connect to any other cjdns user as long as they're in the same peer graph (hyperboria)\n- you peer with [your friends](%ZSnWOBSoPrG247yOdSNimSYGY+IUmTUqOjbp4GOK5AY=.sha256), which route your connections to others in the network\n  - it's kind of like SSB if you squint really hard and don't think about it much\n  - like SSB, you *could* peer over an offline or mesh connection, but most of us peer over the internet\n\nMy main issue running a pub on a Pi was that I couldn't get a public IP or port forward from my router, but with cjdns I just add some peers and then anyone else in hyperboria can connect to me without any issues. Super neat.",
