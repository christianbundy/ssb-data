When trying to decide between open source licenses I was bummed that even the permissive licenses (MIT, ITC, ...) used copyright to enforce attribution, so I took the ISC license and removed the attribution clause and had it approved by the OSI as the [Free Public License](https://web.archive.org/web/20181107180216/https://opensource.org/licenses/FPL-1.0.0). It's now called the [Zero-clause BSD](https://opensource.org/licenses/0BSD) license, but it's the exact same text. \r\n\r\nAnyway, I still feel a strong tension between \"don't use copyright to threaten state violence\" (0BSD) and \"don't let companies extract profit from the commons\" ([PPL](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Peer_Production_License). \r\n\r\n> I may shame someone if theyâ€™re being a dick with my work. But otherwise, meh.\r\n\r\nDo you think of reciprocal sharealike-style licensing as an antipattern here? I've been thinking about this problem for *years* but I'm still stuck and unsure how to license my \"intellectual\" \"property\"."
