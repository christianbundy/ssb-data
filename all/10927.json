I've wanted to try JSON-LD for this sort of thing, which accomplishes the above with:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://example.com/nmaro/ssb-projects/v1\",\n  \"@type\": \"task\",\n  \"foo\": \"bar\"\n}\n```\n\nWith that said: try out whatever you'd like! I don't think there's been much experimentation with schema versioning, so we haven't settled on any best practices yet. Lots more info and opinions in this thread: %qTEUjQajo0VCc6RkoCBdG/Klqo1LKCsHfaK+RQP0kdI=.sha256\n\nAnother approach would be to use an existing RDF schema published somewhere else. For example, a task could be described by a schema.org [Action](https://schema.org/Action), so you'd have:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": \"http://schema.org/version/2.0/\",\n  \"@type\": \"Action\",\n  \"agent\": \"ssb:feed:ed25519:zEbr4oS0j1O41UYGBVbay-4NvAc2yfJi43yW3Yx28BI=\",\n  \"actionStatus\": \"CompletedActionStatus\",\n  \"object\": \"https://example.com/some/task\"\n}\n```\n\nThe trade-off is that you get well-specified data types but your messages become super verbose and enterprisey. I don't know if the trade-off is worth it, but it's an option. ðŸ¤· Happy to discuss further, but feel free to experiment.",
