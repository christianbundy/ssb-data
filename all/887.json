A relevant tangent, but a tangent nonetheless.\n\n---\n\n[@ibob](@vkdMlsuBgzzo5eLS3LZLdqnBpZ26OauJOMIq9gQ2E7E=.ed25519)\n\n> I have never experienced occult events or visitations by aliens, neither do I expect to.\n\nA few years ago I moved to Chicago on a whim, and stayed for a few months, but I'm still confused by an experience I had there. I'm sure it was just a mundane slip of the imagination, but it's still carved out distinctly as a memory in my head.\n\nI lived on the third story of an old apartment building in Chicago near Lincoln park. I lived on a studio apartment on the third floor of a five or six story building, and I leased the place while I was in California. I showed up in Chicago with only a backpack, called the maintenance guy (who eventually inherited many of my belongings), and found myself in an empty room full of nothing. I think I may have shipped myself a few boxes of stuff, as I distinctly remember cardboard boxes from Home Depot.\n\nI had four windows: two in my bedroom and a small one in the bathroom at eye level. It was a fine place to live, but it was my first time living more than a few hundred miles away. I had a habit of smoking cannabis every few nights for a while, back when the Magic Flight Launch Box was still a thing. It's possible that it was caused by the anxiety of living in a new place, cannabis, normal brain activity, or even *abnormal* brain activity, but it's still in my head.\n\n![IMG_4578.JPG](&gnHF2VGsKzt86PS1yoxLLiHVJxPvgxAERX/2CsGeHnA=.sha256)\n\nOne morning I woke up feeling funny. I had a habit of drinking coffee every morning for a while, back when the single-use Keurig machine was still a thing. I jumped in the shower and opened the window, but after a few seconds of looking out the window I felt my gut drop. I have a vivid memory of what happened, but I can't believe it's something that happened in our sober and shared reality. \n\nI woke up around 03:00 to the anxious feeling that something was outside my window. Nothing looked visually different, but I was confident that there was *something* in the alley that was trying to communicate with me. I was under the impression that there was an intelligent being communicating with me, inviting me. I remember asking questions telepathically and asking for details, but the experience would loop back to their invitation. \n\nThey assured me that my choice was my own, and that I could decline without consequences. I knew that I was being invited to \"go up\" with them, and that if I went \"up\" that I wouldn't remember my decision. As luck would have it, I don't remember my decision.\n\n![IMG_4257.JPG](&ZEo22cihfLgBtYFxmz9XzGi0bcX3FhsMKDYHjCzZimA=.sha256)\n\nI think I was late to work that day. I'm still not sure what to make of it, but I know it only happened in my head. If you walked through the alley that night I'm sure you wouldn't have seen any thing. Hell, I'm not even sure I actually woke up in the middle of the night, but the experience was potent and hard to ignore. It doesn't surprise me to hear people the weird stories that humans have accumulated over our history, but I think that once you get past the \"brains are bad and unreliable\" thing it's much easier to resist superstition.\n\nI wonder whether the stigma of hallucinations, delusions, and other scary brain things have kept people from having healthy conversations about things that aren't real. I'm not sure that *everyone* has stories like mine, but I'd be willing to bet that many or most people have had experiences that can't be studied in our shared and sober reality. Alternatively, I'm the only one who has similar experiences and I'm outing myself as a total weirdo.\n\nTL;DR: Brains are bad and unreliable, avoid unless absolutely necessary.",
