A few years ago I donated most of my belongings and tried to do the digital nomad thing in Europe, but it only took a few weeks until I was completely disenchanted by the lifestyle.

For example, I was *really* looking forward to getting back into an exercise routine once I was a bit less nomadic, but that never really happened once I moved back to my home country...",
