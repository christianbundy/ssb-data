I've never seen a technical opinion of yours that wasn't valuable, and I want to stress that every personal interaction I've ever had with you has been overwhelmingly positive, both here and on Decent.\n\nSomehow that was lost in my write-edit-copy-edit-shitwheredidthatlinkgo-copy-paste-edit cycle, so I want to apologize for spending a less-than-necessary amount of time clarifying that fact. Scaling communities means that there will eventually be beef, but I'm hoping we can deal with conflicts in a healthy way that doesn't deteriorate our edges or compromise the Very Good Things about this space.",
