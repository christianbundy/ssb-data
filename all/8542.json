For example, january.example.com, which exists like pop-up shop for a month, but then deletes all content and creates a new feed as february.example.com? It would still serve its purpose to introduce folks that joined during a specific time period, but would avoid the problem where you join a pub and have to sync everyone who has *ever* joined the pub.\n\n#pub #scuttlebutt ",
