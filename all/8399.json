    "text": "My excitement about this has been rekindled a bit, and I'm thinking that this could be a fun pattern to build an SSB message viewer:\n\n1. Create a small HTML app, which follows the following instructions:\n    1. Read the URI path and ensure that it starts with `ssb:message`.\n    2. Make an AJAX request to http://localhost/ssb:message:sha1:[...]\n    3. Format the message with some super simple CSS. \n2. Add the app as a Scuttlebutt blob.\n3. Configure the localhost to always serve the above blob when someone requests http://patchlite.localhost/\n4. Open http://patchlite.localhost/ssb:message:sha256:g3hPVPDEO1Aj_uPl0-J2NlhFB2bbFLIHlty-YuqFZ3w=\n5. You should (?!) see your message renderered\n\nThe downside to this approach is that it doesn't give us access to any flumedb views, but I suppose if they each had a URI then they'd be web-accessible, right? I should probably hack a bit on the above before daydreaming about the possible future(s)."
