    "text": "I'd be happy to pay a friend to run a Raspberry Pi or something from their house, but I don't think data centers or server farms are necessarily. This sort of thing could help distribute both data *and* risk without offloading all of our responsibilities to Google, Amazon, Microsoft, or other \"cloud\" providers, and may give us the ability to have our friends host our infrastructure (just like how you're hosting my feed). Just my two cents, though."
