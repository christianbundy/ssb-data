The political idea is that _generally_ if your population is so large that you need to start drawing lines in the sand, that you'd better start with the naturally existing lines (which trees go where, common weather patterns, etc) rather than who invaded who 500 years ago.\n\nMy favorite example of this, [Cascadia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascadia_(bioregion)), is great because it extends between the US and Canada, hinting at the idea that folks like me in the Northwestern US have more in common with Southeastern Canada than either of us have with the rest of the country.\n\nThese ideas are also useful in practice for outdoor activities like hiking (and #sar), where you can make generalizations based on bioregions rather than states. I'm in NW Oregon, and even though I'm confident being outdoors basically anywhere in Cascadia I'm not sure that my experiences or gear would be suitable for SE Oregon (which is a bit more desert-like).\n\n![ca.png](&c5LqY4E4Vc7TujM7NQIeJ3PBH8VJD3d//D8X+pazpXM=.sha256)\n\nThe lines are a bit fuzzy, but bioregions are [at least] a thought-provoking exercise in how boundaries and drawn and why.",
