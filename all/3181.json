Tons of posts start with Markdown, which doesn't fit nicely into the paradigm of post titles, so there likely aren't any clean solutions. I'm currently splitting on a newline or at 100 characters, whichever comes first, but plenty of would-be titles have links and images or (like this post) use `#` to denote a header.\n\n![patchbay forum bulletin board](&kNIWX3JRL9VB9ncIPEL2XGRUSzQ8ALjf7zg/CB689mI=.sha256)\n\nI feel an urge to work on how content is displayed, but seems like it may be a dead end.\n\nPS: Please disregard the ugly -- this was mostly just an experiment to see whether the idea of an ergonomic post title would be easy to implement.",
