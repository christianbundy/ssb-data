Deploy a server to Digital Ocean or something (bad, I want it to exist locally), or\n2. Use a service like https://noip.com (not great, at the mercy of a for-profit), or\n3. Require that remote users install something like Tor, I2P, IPFS, Dat, or whatever (eh, not user-friendly)\n\nCan anyone suggest a non-awful way to do this? I'm sure I'm not the first person to consider doing this and I'm trying to avoid reinventing the wheel.",
