Here's what's currently here:\n\n- two bar stools\n- a couch\n- a reading chair\n- a desk chair\n- a bed\n- an outdoor table\n- two outdoor chairs\n\nHow did this happen?! I'd generally consider myself a minimalist but I've got a ton of crap. I'm thinking I'll likely keep my bed, as sleeping in a hammock full-time is (IMO) only doable when sleeping alone, but I kind of want to ditch everything else. What do you all do for furniture? Is going furniture-free ( #furniture-free) a thing?",
