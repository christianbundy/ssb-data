Neither of my cats has had the opportunity to check out a hammock, since my hammock stand broke a few years ago. My original thought was that they'd rip right through them, but maybe they'd love them!\n\n[@nanomonkey](@+D0ku/LReK6kqd3PSrcVCfbLYbDtTmS4Bd21rqhpYNA=.ed25519) \n\nMan, these hit me so hard. I kept putting off replying because I wanted to be able to sit down and express how meaningful those stories were, but I'm not sure I'll be able to. I've lost all but a few of the animals in my life, and those cats all seem like wonderful friends to have.\n\n[@ibob](@vkdMlsuBgzzo5eLS3LZLdqnBpZ26OauJOMIq9gQ2E7E=.ed25519) \n\nThat's a wonderful photo, and I swear I can practically feel that \"a cat is laying on me and now I'm not allowed to move\". Is that Sooty sitting on the arm of the couch? That forehead nuzzle is probably my favorite kind of affection from a cat.",
