It sounds like you believe that others have an obligation to host your content, and I'm confused at why or how you believe this.\n\nSetting the number of default hops to `n` has the same effect as blocking people above `n` degrees of separation. Do you also take offense to people setting the number of hops that they're interested in hosting? I don't think that you can maintain any sort of consistency here without falling into \"I have the right to be hosted by everyone\".",
